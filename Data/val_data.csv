"Munich , Germany , 02 November 2010 , TOMORROW FOCUS AG , one of Germany 's foremost exchange-listed internet groups , once again maintained its established track record of growth in the third quarter of 2010 . According to the final figures , the Group 's revenue for the first three quarters was higher than in any previous year in its history and even exceeded that for the entire financial year 2009 . In detail , consolidated revenue for the first nine months of 2010 was up 47.1 percent year-on-year , from EUR 63.9 million to EUR 94.0 million . Revenue for the third quarter of 2010 showed a year-on-year increase of 50.9 percent from EUR 23.1 million to EUR 34.8 million . This can be attributed to a marked growth in revenue in both the E-Commerce and Portal segments . In the E-Commerce segment , this was largely due to a substantial increase in the number of travel bookings using HolidayCheck , while in the Portal segment the main factors were growth in advertising bookings in the area of premium marketing and the fact that AdJug Ltd. had not yet been consolidated in the comparative figures for the previous year . There was also a major improvement in all other consolidated earnings , despite the considerable sums invested in further corporate growth . Group earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortisation ( Group EBITDA ) for the first nine months of 2010 was up 39.8 percent to EUR 12.1 million , in comparison with EUR 8.6 million over the same period in the previous year . Group EBITDA for the third quarter of 2010 rose to EUR 5.1 million from EUR 2.9 million in the same quarter of the previous year ( up 75.6 percent ) . Group earnings before interest and taxes ( Group EBIT ) for the first three quarters of 2010 grew to EUR 8.0 million from EUR 5.9 million in a year-on-year comparison ( up 35.6 percent ) . Group EBIT in the third quarter of 2010 grew to EUR 3.7 million from EUR 2.0 million in the same quarter in the previous year ( up 88.9 percent ) . Group earnings before taxes ( Group EBT ) for the first nine months of 2010 were up 148.3 percent at EUR 5.7 million compared to the figure of EUR 2.3 million for the same period in 2009 . Group EBT for the third quarter of 2010 improved to EUR 3.2 million , as compared with EUR 1.4 million in the same quarter of 2009 ( up 121.9 percent ) Consolidated net income for the period before minority interest in the first three quarters improved to EUR 3.6 million in 2010 from EUR 0.6 million in 2009 ( up 468.3 percent ) . Consolidated net income for the period before minority interest for the third quarter of 2010 grew to EUR 2.5 million , as compared with EUR 0.8 million in a year-on-year comparison ( up 206.6 percent ) . Consolidated net income for the period after minority interest for the first nine months of 2010 grew to EUR 4.4 million , compared to a figure of EUR 1.0 million in a year-on-year comparison ( up 325.9 percent ) . Consolidated net income for the period after minority interest in the third quarter of 2010 increased to EUR 2.7 million , as compared with EUR 1.0 million for the same quarter in 2009 ( up 32.6 percent ) . Consolidated earnings per share in the first nine months of 2010 were up to EUR 0.08 compared with EUR 0.02 in the first three quarters of the previous year . Earnings per share in the third quarter of 2010 amounted to EUR 0.05 compared to EUR 0.02 in the same quarter of 2009 . The sale of shares in Playboy Publishing Deutschland GmbH took place in the fourth quarter of 2010 and is therefore not reflected in these figures . Looking ahead at the fourth quarter of 2010 , the Management Board of TOMORROW FOCUS AG anticipates a continued high level of growth . The focus will be on efforts to achieve a further substantial increase in the Group 's earnings . The German version of the interim report for the first three quarters of 2010 will be made available on our website at www.tomorrow-focus.de by 12 November 2010 at the latest .

"elexis AG ad hoc disclosure within the meaning of Section 15 of the WpHG on the results of the first nine months of 2010 * Order intake up significantly by 23 percent to EUR 110.9 million * EBIT nearly triples to EUR 7.3 million * Significant increase in cash flow from operating activities and high net liquidity * Forecast for 2010 confirmed Wenden , November 2 , 2010 , The elexis group , a specialist for automation solutions and quality assurance , concluded the third quarter with a substantial increase in order intake and EBIT . In addition to a large number of sales and service companies in Europe and the USA , the elexis group has already had production facilities in BRIC countries for several years . This is a key success factor in the current shift in demand from industrialised nations to emerging nations and an excellent starting point for the elexis group 's future profitable growth . Order intake , revenues and earnings Order intake was up by 23 percent and totalled EUR 110.9 million on September 30 , 2010 ( previous year EUR 90.4 million ) . The increase in the elexis group 's order book can be seen later on in its revenues . During the period under review revenues totalled EUR 98.7 million and were thus slightly higher than in the same period of the previous year ( September 30 , 2009 EUR 95.0 million ) . The book-to-bill ratio was 1.12 . Despite the fact that revenues remained practically constant , elexis was able to increase its EBIT ( earnings before interest and taxes ) significantly from EUR 2.5 million on September 30 , 2009 to EUR 7.3 million at the end of the period under review . This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 7.4 percent compared to 2.6 percent in the previous year . The sustained increase in earnings is the result of international activities and the successful cost cuts made in 2009 and the first half of 2010 . Consolidated earnings after the deduction of minority interests totalled EUR 3.5 million at the end of the third quarter . This figure totalled just EUR 0.5 million in the previous year . Earnings per share also increased from EUR 0.05 ( September 30 , 2009 ) to EUR 0.38 as of September 30 , 2010 . Growth in the divisions ` High Quality Automation ' continues to be the group 's most important segment . It accounts for 87 percent of the elexis group 's revenues . Despite the various phases in the value chain and the late cyclical growth in parts of the product range , order intake as of September 30 , 2010 was up 11 percent and totalled EUR 91.1 million ( previous year EUR 82.2 million ) . Revenues of EUR 85.7 million were on a par with the previous year 's level ( September 30 , 2009 EUR 84.1 million ) . The downswing last year from the focus on different markets and phases in the value chain was reflected in revenues at a later date , and this area is now also participating in the upswing from positive economic developments with a time lag . Despite the fact that revenues remained constant , High Quality Automation recorded EBIT ( earnings before interest and taxes ) of EUR 11.9 million at the end of the period under review ( September 30 , 2009 EUR 6.2 million ) . This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 13.9 percent . This margin was 7.4 percent last year . The increase in earnings is also the result of the consistent cost cuts in prior periods . The High Precision Automation segment recorded order intake in the first nine months of 2010 that was up 141 percent year-on-year . In spite of this , however , the order book of EUR 19.8 million at the end of the third quarter is not yet satisfactory ( previous year EUR 8.2 million ) . Revenues as of September 30 , 2010 totalled EUR 13.0 million compared to EUR 11.0 million in the previous year . This division is characterised by long project cycles , which can be up to one year . Business growth in this segment was in line with these project cycles . Given this background , the dramatic slump in order intake in 2009 only fully impacted earnings during the current fiscal year . In the first nine months of the year this division recorded EBIT of EUR -3.4 million ( September 30 , 2009 EUR -2.2 million ) . This figure includes trade fair costs ( development costs , trade fair machines ) for medical technology products in the amount of EUR 0.8 million . Expansion of the medical technology segment will be driven significantly during the current fiscal year . In addition , a substantial drop in prices for equipment burdened earnings growth . It will no longer be possible to turn this segment around in 2010 as planned . As a result of the time-shift in order intake , positive earnings will be recorded in the first half of 2011 . Equity and other KPIs The group 's cash flow from operating activities improved again significantly in the third quarter of 2010 . Compared to EUR 0.2 million in the previous year , the cash flow from operating activities on the balance sheet date totalled EUR 9.2 million . The equity ratio of 51.2 percent ( previous year 52.7 percent ) and the increased net liquidity of EUR 18.4 million ( previous year EUR 10.7 million ) put the elexis group on a sound financial footing in the period under review . Outlook The improved economic perspectives , the international presence , the top-quality range of products and services and the cost cuts totalling EUR 14.7 million implemented in 2009 mean that the elexis group can look to the future with confidence . Given this background , the Managing Board has confirmed its forecast for 2010 . Order intake of between EUR 140 and 150 million is forecasted for the year as a whole . Revenues will be in a bandwidth of between EUR 135 to 140 million . The EBIT margin is expected to total 6 to 8 percent in the current fiscal year . The management believes that there are excellent opportunities to record an EBIT margin of more than 10 percent again in 2011 .

"Passau , November 03 , 2010 , Consolidation of the figures for the nine-month report of InTiCa Systems AG ( ISIN DE0005874846 , Ticker IS7 ) has revealed that costs were around EUR 0.6 million above budget at group level in the third quarter due to the unfavourable development of unit costs . This was caused by a combination of bottlenecks and quality issues in the supply of raw materials , which led to frequent production changeovers at short notice and production of small batches due to the start-up of new product series , plus high costs for special deliveries . Also , the unexpected cost burden was particularly attributable to higher production start-up costs for a large number of new products . The plan discrepancy should be largely eliminated in the fourth quarter thanks to an improvement in the delivery situation at suppliers and more stable production processes . As a result , unit costs and the corresponding marginal income should return to a normal level . The additional expenses incurred up to now are unlikely to be offset in full . As a result , the company will not achieve a profit for fiscal 2010 . Due to the excellent order situation , the Board of Directors raises its sales forecast for 2011 from EUR 34 million to over EUR 40 million EUR . With the current order backlog of around EUR 45 million ( 2009 EUR 11 million ) , the Board sees a sales increase by more than 35 % compared to 2010 for fiscal year 2011 as realistic .

The order backlog as of September 30 , 2010 amounted to EUR 108.0 million ( September 30 , 2009 EUR 57.6 million ) . Gross profit margin in the third quarter rose to 41.9 % from 39.0 % in the corresponding year-earlier period as a result of several high-margin orders in the Lithography division . However , the gross profit margin for the year to date was 36.9 % , reflecting certain lower-margin Bonder systems , which were delivered in the second quarter of 2010 as part of strategic R and D cooperative agreements . Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) developed very positively in the third quarter of 2010 , totaling EUR 5.0 million , which corresponds to an EBIT margin of approximately 13.5 % . As a result , it was possible to generate EBIT of EUR 8.4 million in the first nine months of 2010 ( 9M 2009 EUR 1.2 million ) . During the first nine months of 2010 , extraordinary effects of about EUR 0.2 million were recorded as a result of business combinations and restructuring measures . The net impact of these extraordinary effects improved earnings , whereby EUR 1.5 million accrued to the period from January to June and EUR -1.3 million to the period July to September . The extraordinary effects primarily consisted of the following . , The initial consolidation of HamaTech APE GmbH and Co. . KG resulted in badwill of EUR 2.7 million . , Restructuring expenses of EUR -0.3 million resulted from the amalgamation of the production sites in Vaihingen and Sternenfels . , As of the end of September 2010 , restructuring expenses of EUR -2.2 million were incurred due to the relocation of the Substrate Bonder division from the USA to Germany . Without these extraordinary effects , EBIT in the first nine months of 2010 would have totaled EUR 8.2 million , corresponding to an EBIT margin of 8.5 % . Earnings after taxes ( EAT ) amounted to EUR 3.6 million , compared with EUR 0.5 million in the corresponding period of the previous year . Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) therefore totaled EUR 0.19 ( 9M 2009 EUR 0.03 ) . Free cash flow before the inclusion of securities and extraordinary effects from M and A activities came to EUR 3.8 million at the nine month mark , after EUR 5.6 million in the same period of the previous year . As of September 30 , 2010 , the SUSS MicroTec Group therefore has cash and interest-bearing securities of EUR 39.2 million ( December 31 , 2009 EUR 31.1 million ) . The net cash position grew significantly in comparison to the end of the 2009 fiscal year from EUR 18.4 million to EUR 23.5 million ( 9M 2009 EUR 15.3 million ) . Outlook Given strong order entry in the second and third quarters of 2010 , we are assuming order entry of EUR 170 million for the full year 2010 . For the entire year , we anticipate sales of approximately EUR 140 million and EBIT in the EUR 11-13 million range . This incorporates one-time restructuring expenses of EUR 4.5 million related to the relocation of the Substrate Bonder division from the USA to Germany . We will also be able to generate a positive free cash flow ( before effects of M and A activities already carried out ) in the 2010 fiscal year .

"- Vidofludimus generates a response rate of 88.5 % for the treatment of patients with Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis - Planegg-Martinsried , Germany , 04 November , 2010 , 4SC AG ( Frankfurt , Prime Standard VSC ) , a drug discovery and development company focused on autoimmune and cancer indications , today announced positive preliminary results of a Phase IIa study in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) with its lead autoimmune compound vidofludimus , an oral inhibitor of interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) release . The exploratory , open-label , single-arm Phase IIa ENTRANCE study met its primary endpoint of significantly increasing the response rate in corticosteroid-dependent IBD patients to 88.5 % versus an average placebo response across published benchmark clinical trials of approximately 20 % . Following completion of a twelve week treatment phase with vidofludimus , disease remission was maintained in 14 out of 26 patients ( 53.9 % ) without intake of any corticosteroids ( complete responders ) . A further 9 out of 26 patients ( 34.6 % ) remained in remission at the end of the study treatment period at a corticosteroid dose equal to or below the patients ' individual threshold doses ( partial responders ) at which they experienced a documented disease relapse prior to entry into the study . Overall , vidofludimus significantly increased the number of patients with response ( complete and partial responders = 88.5 % ) compared to the pre-defined placebo rate criterion of 20 % . Vidofludimus was well tolerated with no critical safety issues observed . These are preliminary results prior to database lock and , therefore , subject to final review .",15.94203,15.95059,True,True
"- Operating result of EUR 24.3 million already within upgraded target corridor for full year , Revenue of EUR 311 million after 9 months already exceeds total for the entire previous year ( EUR 309 million ) , Almost two-thirds of revenue generated outside Germany in Q3 , Positive outlook for 2011 thanks to strong international sales organization Munich , November 4 , 2010 , Thanks to CENTROSOLAR 's strong position in all major international markets for photovoltaic roof systems , the company was likewise able to post revenue of more than EUR 100 million in the third quarter ( +25 % on previous year ) . Almost two-thirds of revenue for the quarter was generated outside Germany . Growth internationally reached 85 % over the same quarter a year ago . With revenue of EUR 311 million , the company has consequently already bettered the total for the whole of the previous year after only 9 months and is all of 53 % up on the prior-year period . With an operating result before interest and taxes of EUR 24.3 million , CENTROSOLAR has furthermore already achieved its target for the current financial year , which it had previously already upgraded substantially . Earnings per share after the first nine months are EUR 0.73 . The healthy revenue performance in the third quarter , despite the drastic cut in the German feed-in tariff from July 1 , 2010 , was achieved mainly thanks to the notable success in increasing CENTROSOLAR 's international presence . In Italy , for instance , revenue was more than trebled compared with the prior-year quarter and accounted for about 14 % of total revenue in the past quarter . In France , too , the revenue share was increased to almost one-third . Other future markets for CENTROSOLAR are the USA , Benelux and the UK . The operating result for the third quarter was diminished in particular by temporary bottlenecks in the procurement of cells and raw glass . The resulting higher procurement costs are reflected in a lower gross margin than for the first half . A product change within mounting systems and an increase in module manufacturing capacity from 155 MWp to almost 200 MWp also represented temporary burdens . Third-quarter earnings were in line with the expectations voiced at the end of the first half , the assessment of the situation is now even more positive . The upper figures for the bandwidths will probably be exceeded for revenue ( EUR 370 million ) and probably achieved in the case of earnings ( EUR 28 million ) . In view of the likely price reductions at the start of 2011 , a conservative approach to purchasing and therefore also sales is planned for Q4_2010 . The regulatory trend towards higher subsidies for roof systems than open-site systems in markets such as Germany , the Czech Republic and Italy chimes with CENTROSOLAR 's strategic position , with an area-wide sales network in the main markets for photovoltaic roof systems and a flexible purchasing policy . It is likely to profit from the general easing of the situation on general procurement markets , whereas further opportunities for growth are arising in the company 's specific sales markets . CENTROSOLAR thus anticipates further revenue growth and a thoroughly satisfactory margin in the 2011 financial year .",-3.333335,-3.574007,False,False

"DIC Asset AG ( German Securities ID 509840 _ ISIN DE0005098404 ) today presented its interim report for the first nine months of the 2010 financial year . The Company performed well in its operating business , in a market environment that continues to be challenging , following up on the good results achieved during the first two quarters of the year to date . FFO ( funds from operations , defined as earnings before interest and taxes , excluding profits from disposals and development projects ) of EUR 33.1 million was slightly lower than the figure for the same period of the previous year ( 9m 2009 EUR 35.6 million ) . FFO per share for the first nine months amounted to EUR 0.91 ( 9m 2009 EUR 1.16 ) . Results were boosted by the volume of new rentals ( up 9 per cent ) , and by the renewed reduction in net interest expenses , whilst the lower portfolio size ( on account of disposals ) and the fact that the Company has not yet fully replaced some lease expiries . Profit for the period was EUR 9.5 million ( 9m 2009 EUR 11.5 million ) . The Company was also successful in sustainably improving its financing structure , by refinancing several obligations early . Detailed review of results for the quarter DIC Asset AG 's total revenues for the first three quarters of 2010 amounted to EUR 135.9 million , a 6.6 per cent increase compared with the first nine months of 2009 ( 9m 2009 EUR 127.6 million ) . The main factor contributing to this increase was the markedly higher volume of sales during the reporting period , this led to proceeds of EUR 23.2 million being recognized in income ( 9m 2009 EUR 10.2 million ) . The aggregate volume of sales stood at EUR 107 million by mid-October , which already clearly exceeded the original full-year target of EUR 60 million . Despite difficult market conditions for rentals still prevailing , DIC Asset AG again performed strongly during the third quarter , bringing the total letting volume for the period ending 30 September 2010 to 193,900 m ( Q3 2010 77,600 m ) , significantly exceeding the previous year 's figures ( 9m 2009 178,300 m ) . Follow-up rentals accounted for 115,300 m ( 9m 2009 approx . 100,000 m ) , whilst new rentals of 78,600 m virtually matched the 78,500 m achieved during the first three quarters of 2009 . New rentals during the first nine months of 2010 were equivalent to annualised rental income of EUR 20.4 million ( 9m 2009 EUR 17.3 million ) . The marked increase reflected a strong increase in the share of office rentals , which account for higher average rents . Net interest expense of EUR 54 million was down by a marked 4.2 % ( 9m 2009 EUR 56.3 million ) , with the average interest rate at 4.50 per cent ( 9m 2009 4.65 per cent ) . Administrative expenses for the period decreased to EUR 5.9 million ( down 14.5 per cent ) , whilst staff expenses increased by 7.1 per cent , to EUR 7.1 million , as projected . Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation ( EBDA ) of EUR 33.1 million was slightly lower than the EUR 34.2 million figure posted for the first nine months of the previous year . Profit for the period of EUR 9.5 million ( 9m 2009 EUR 11.5 million ) is equivalent to earnings per share of EUR 0.26 ( 9m 2009 EUR 0.37 ) . DIC Asset AG 's total assets amounted to approx . EUR 2.2 billion as at 30 September 2010 . Long-term assets remained stable , at EUR 2.1 billion . Medium-term or long-term fixed interest rate agreements or hedges are in place for 83 per cent of financial debt of EUR 1.6 billion . Only approx . 15 per cent of overall financial debt will fall due within the next 24 months . During the third quarter , the Company renewed two portfolio financings with an aggregate size of approx . EUR 85 million prior to maturity , with another EUR 104 million early prolongation closed in October . More than 75 per cent of the EUR 117 million equity for the announced debut ` DIC Office Balance I ' fund has been already placed by the end of September 2010 . Backed by this high level of initial placements , the fund already commenced operations on 15 October , with the transfer of real estate assets to the fund . The fund was subscribed to by institutional investors , predominantly pension funds , foundations , insurance companies and family offices , expanding DIC Asset AG 's investor base to include additional long-term business partners . Further investors will be invited to subscribe to DIC 's debut special investment fund within the scope of the final marketing round . Investors in the fund gain exposure to a EU 211 million portfolio of first-class real estate in metropolitan regions throughout Germany . All properties are let to prime tenants under long-term agreements , thus allowing investors to benefit from distributions from the very beginning . DIC Asset AG will retain a minority shareholding of 20 per cent , and will provide its renowned investment and real estate management services to the fund . On top of investment income , the new business segment will generate regular and stable income from the services rendered . Outlook for 2010 DIC Asset AG affirms its most recent FFO forecast of EUR 41-43 million for the full year 2010 .

"Ad hoc disclosure in line with section 15 WpHG Masterflex AG Plan to sell Mobility group resolved Gelsenkirchen , 10 November 2010 . At its meeting today , the Executive Board of Masterflex AG decided to sell the Mobility group , the last remaining non-core business activity of the Masterflex Group . The sale of the Mobility group will complete the restructuring of the Group initiated in 2008 as part of the Group 's long-term strategy to focus its activities on the core business High-Tech Hose Systems and to sell off activities not related to this . The Group is now actively seeking a buyer for the Mobility group and is already holding initial discussions for this purpose . Write-downs will be incurred as a result of the reclassification of the business unit as ` held for sale ' . For instance , a possible deconsolidation loss of up to EUR 3.5 million is expected , equivalent to roughly half of the loans extended to the companies in the Mobility unit and the work performed and still capitalized at Masterflex AG of approximately EUR 0.5 million . These write-downs will not affect the liquidity situation of the Masterflex Group , but equity will decrease by the depreciation amounts specified . On the basis of commercial prudence , a negative impact on the balance sheet of Masterflex AG , adjusted and restructured following the parallel restructuring of the balance sheet equity and liabilities , should therefore be largely ruled out in future due to past effects . Explanatory text . The high growth and diversification strategy of years following the IPO led to a high level of debt and considerable distortions of the balance sheet . In the 2008 financial year , the absolutely essential restructuring measures to refocus Masterflex AG 's activities on the core business High-Tech Hose Systems were begun , as the debt burden in particular had by then grown to an overwhelming extent , even threatening the company 's survival . In all years , hose business was a reliable and by far the biggest earnings driver in the Masterflex Group , consistently generating stable cash flows and attractive margins . Furthermore , the name Masterflex has stood for outstanding expertise in the entire High-Tech Hose Systems market for over twenty years . With the deconsolidation of the Mobility unit , which has no synergies with the core business and whose performance has fallen significantly short of the expectations of the Executive Board of Masterflex AG , the restructuring initiated in 2008 will be completed by the end of the year . The Executive Board will press ahead quickly with the sale process and will actively examine separate sales of individual Mobility equity investments and_or cooperations with partners as well as a complete sale of the Group . A current absence of sufficient market assessments and a lack of purchase offers make it difficult to judge the possible balance-sheet effects . Because the Mobility group is an internally established group of companies , no goodwill is capitalized here and the question of a revaluation therefore does not arise . However , the establishment and expansion of the business was pre-financed with loans in the past . In total , there are receivables of around EUR 5.0 million from various subsidiaries of the Mobility group . In addition , development expenses of roughly EUR 0.5 million were capitalized . In addition to inventories ( around EUR 2.0 million ) , these are also countered by patents and a business model with high potential for expansion .",-4.495285,-6.876887,False,False

"Cologne , November 10 , 2010 . Sedo Holding AG today announced its consolidated figures for the first nine months of 2010 . Business progressed in line with the company 's expectations . As expected , consolidated sales of Sedo Holding AG fell from EUR 105.4 million last year to EUR 83.9 million in the first nine months of 2010 . The main reason for the fall in sales is the changed contractual relationship with a major Affiliate Marketing customer as of the fourth quarter of 2009 . Adjusted for sales revenues generated with this one major customer , sales increased by EUR 2.9 million ( _ 3.6 _ ) . Due to a change in the sales mix , there was an increase in gross margin from 20.0 _ in the first nine months of 2009 to 23.7 _ in the first nine months of 2010 . As a result of the improved interest result , earnings before taxes ( EBT ) rose slightly from EUR 3.7 million ( comparable prior-year figure without positive special items of EUR 12.7 million ) to EUR 3.9 million .

Operative cash flow from continued operations improved from EUR 5.1 million in the same period last year to EUR 5.3 million as of September 30 , 2010 . After progressing as expected in the first nine months , business has so far fallen short of the company 's expectations in the fourth quarter . On the basis of current market conditions , the Management Board of Sedo Holding AG does not believe this shortfall can be made up in the remaining course of the quarter .

"- Sales up 15.0 _ in first nine months to EUR 1,409.0 million , EBITDA stable at prior-year level despite strong increase in expenditure Montabaur , November 10 , 2010 . The Management Board of United Internet AG ( ISIN DE0005089031 ) today announced the consolidated results according to IFRS for the first nine months of 2010 . Group development In the first nine months of 2010 , consolidated sales of United Internet AG grew by 15.0 _ from EUR 1,224.8 million last year to EUR 1,409.0 million . Despite expenditure for the current DSL quality drive and high start-up costs for new business fields , now totaling EUR 58.3 million , there was a slight year-on-year increase in earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) to EUR 270.8 million ( prior year EUR 269.1 million , without special items of EUR 50.2 million from the sale of shares ) . Due in particular to scheduled depreciation of EUR 16.2 million on freenet 's DSL customer base acquired in late 2009 , earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) fell as expected by 8.3 _ to EUR 210.6 million ( prior year EUR 229.6 million ) . Earnings per share ( EPS ) fell accordingly from EUR 0.57 ( comparable prior-year figure ) to EUR 0.53 . Operative cash flow rose by 7.6 _ from EUR 193.8 million last year to EUR 208.5 million . In the third quarter , sales were up 16.9 _ on the previous year to EUR 478.2 million ( prior year EUR 409.1 million ) . In this quarter , United Internet made a further significant increase in expenditure for the establishment and development of new business fields , especially for the marketing of new Mobile Internet products and the Do-it-Yourself Homepage . With total expenditure of EUR 39.1 million , the company invested more than twice as much as in the first two quarters together ( EUR 8.7 million in Q1 and EUR 10.5 million in Q2 ) . At the same time , negotiations concerning pre-service invoices which had been queried were successfully concluded . The resulting reimbursements for previous periods totaling EUR 19.3 million were used to partially refinance the aforementioned expenses in new business fields . As a result , EBITDA fell by just 6.9 _ to EUR 88.8 million in the third quarter ( prior year EUR 95.4 million ) . _ EBITDA and EBIT Jan. - Sept. 2009 without positive special items of EUR 50.2 million from sale of shares . Segment development ` Access ' segment In the ` Access ' segment , sales in the first nine months of 2010 grew by 21.2 _ to EUR 913.0 million . Despite an extensive DSL quality drive and expenses incurred in the third quarter for the marketing launch of Mobile Internet products , EBITDA improved slightly ( by 0.3 _ ) on the same period last year to reach EUR 102.6 million . However , EBIT was down 16.9 _ on the same prior-year period to EUR 82.8 million , due to scheduled depreciation of EUR 16.2 million on the acquired freenet customer base . The number of fee-based contracts in the Access segment grew by 50,000 contracts , from 3.50 million contracts as of December 31 , 2009 to 3.55 million . Marketing focused on the growth areas of Mobile Internet and complete DSL packages . Accompanied by an extensive TV , print and online marketing campaign , the launch of new Mobile Internet products on July 1 , 2010 was well received by the market . A total of 80,000 new customer contracts were concluded in this field during the third quarter . There was also strong growth in complete DSL contracts ( of particular importance for United Internet ) , with the addition of a further 390,000 customer relationships ( 200,000 in the third quarter ) . However , the number of customer relationships for those business models gradually being phased out ( narrowband , T-DSL and R-DSL ) continued to fall . 420,000 customer relationships were lost or converted to complete DSL packages in the last nine months ( of which 230,000 in the third quarter ) . ` Applications ' segment In the ` Applications ' segment , significant investments were also made in customer growth during the first nine months of 2010 . As a result , the number of fee-based contracts grew by 380,000 to 6.03 million . Although the statistics were pruned of 40,000 foreign contracts following a change in debt collection policy in the third quarter , there was growth of 35,000 contracts from the acquisition of the Mail.com brand . The number of ad-financed accounts around the world grew organically from 26.3 million to 27.3 million . Growth in this segment , however , has slowed since the contract conversion of a major customer of Sedo 's subsidiary affilinet in late 2009 . As a result , the listed subsidiary Sedo Holding AG ( formerly AdLINK Internet Media AG ) posted a fall in sales of 20.4 _ in the first nine months of 2010 , whereas the rest of the segment enjoyed growth of 12.1 _ . Against this backdrop , total segment sales grew by just 5.2 _ to EUR 495.5 million . Despite high development and pre-launch costs for new applications and further international expansion , as well as a significant increase in marketing expenses , EBITDA and EBIT in this segment grew by 6.3 _ to EUR 172.8 million , and by 5.3 _ to EUR 132.5 million , respectively . The growth in customer contracts during the first nine months resulted from the addition of 200,000 new Business Applications contracts ( total 4.21 million ) and 180,000 new Consumer Applications contracts ( total 1.82 million ) . The number of customer contracts in foreign markets ( UK , France , USA , Spain , Austria , Switzerland ) grew by 180,000 to 2.40 million contracts . _ In the third quarter of 2010 , the statistics were pruned of 40,000 foreign contracts ( change in debt collection policy ) , while there was growth of 35,000 contracts from the acquisition of the Mail.com brand . Outlook In view of the successful course of business so far this year , United Internet confirms its forecasts for 2010 and still expects consolidated sales to grow by around 15 _ ( approx . EUR 1.9 billion total sales ) and EBITDA to remain at the record level of the previous year ( EUR 356.1 million without positive special items ) . United Internet will continue to pursue its policy of sustainable growth in 2011 . In order to utilize its wide range of opportunities , the company will once again invest heavily in new business fields in the coming year . In the ` Access ' segment , further growth is expected in the number of customer contracts , especially for products enabling mobile internet usage . In the ` Applications ' segment , the focus in 2011 will be on entering new foreign markets for Business Applications . In the field of Consumer Applications , United Internet will mainly drive the technical integration and subsequent expansion of its newly acquired Mail.com service . As Germany 's leading email provider , the company also intends to make a strong entry into the field of legally secure email communication . The respective legislative procedure for the German ` De-Mail ' system is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011 . Despite the high costs associated with these projects for sustainable growth in customer subscriptions , initial planning indicates that EBITDA in 2011 will reach a similar level to that of the current year .

"- EBIT increased to EUR 6.4 million ( previous year EUR 1.2 million ) , Consolidated turnover of EUR 154 million slightly up on previous year ( EUR 153 million ) , Outlook 2010 annual results ( excluding Bathroom Furnishings ) above previous year 's level Note on the comparability of key ratios Leifheit sold its Bathroom Furnishings division in the second quarter of 2010 . IFRS require that business in this division be shown separately as ` discontinued operations ' in the income statement . As a result , the income statement shows details only for the continuing operations , comprising the former Household Products division and the non-allocable area ( Group functions ) . This means that the current key ratios are only partly comparable with previous year 's figures which still included the Bathroom Furnishings division . For greater comparability a table in the detailed press release ( www.leifheit.de_en_press_corporate-news.html ) and in the financial report for the period ending 30 September 2010 ( available at www.leifheit.de_en_investor-relations_publications_financial-reports.html ) shows a reconciliation with the figures published in the previous year . Group earnings Sale of Bathroom Furnishing division already offset Consolidated Group turnover in the first nine months rose slightly to EUR 154 million . In the previous year , the corresponding segments reported turnover of EUR 153 million . The foreign share was unchanged at 58 % . Consolidated EBIT was EUR 6.4 million , significantly up on the previous year 's level ( after adjusting for the sale of the Bathroom Furnishings division , Q1-Q3_2009 EUR 1.2 million ) As a result , this year 's EBIT will actually exceed the published 2009 EBIT , which was still benefiting from the Bathroom Furnishings division ( Q1-Q3_2009 with Bathroom Furnishings , EUR 4.3 million ) . This favourable outcome is due particularly to the growth of its Brand Business segment ( Leifheit , Dr. Oetker Bakeware , Soehnle ) , where Leifheit has achieved significant growth in margins and cost savings . EBT to 30 September 2010 totalled EUR 4.9 million ( Q1-Q3_2009 , adjusted EUR -0.4 million ) . The Net result for the period , unlike the other components in the income statement , also includes operating results for the sold Bathroom Furnishings division up to the point of deconsolidation and the proceeds from the sale of the division . It totalled EUR 13.7 million ( Q1-Q3_2009 EUR 0.5 million ) . Cash flow from operating activities was EUR 4.5 million ( Q1-Q3_2009 EUR 40.4 million ) . Cash flow from investment activities of EUR 23.3 million also includes the proceeds from the sale of the Bathroom Furnishings division . Business developments in detail After the sale of the Bathroom Furnishings division in the second quarter of 2010 , the company is now organised in the segments ` Brand Business ' ( Leifheit , Dr. Oetker Bakeware and Soehnle ) and ` Volume Business ' ( Birambeau and Herby ) . Brand Business domestic strength The Leifheit , Dr. Oetker Bakeware and Soehnle brands are the basis of the Group 's success . With turnover of EUR 130 million , the brands matched the previous year ( Q1-Q3_2009 EUR 130 million ) , even though the previous year 's turnover still included EUR 6 million from the ladders business ( now sold ) . Almost half of this turnover in the first nine months of the current year was generated outside Germany . Sales in Austria and the Middle East were particularly successful , while in large parts of Europe ( e.g. the Netherlands , Italy , Eastern Europe ) the general cautious mood among consumers led to declines . Cleaning products were particularly successful , benefiting from the success of the TV campaign for the Twist System . The contribution of Brand Business ( which for the first time also included ` Group functions ' ) to consolidated EBIT for the period ending 30 September 2010 rose significantly to EUR 3.6 million ( Q1-Q3_2009 EUR -1.7 million ) . Volume Business continues to grow Turnover of the Volume Business segment , with articles distributed entirely outside Germany by Birambeau ( kitchen ) and Herby ( laundry care ) grew almost 6 % year over year to EUR 24 million ( Q1-Q3_2009 EUR 23 million ) . Volume Business is benefiting from the tight focus on price , specifically in the French market . The segment 's share in consolidated turnover accordingly rose slightly to 16 % . Birambeau boosted its turnover in kitchen appliances by 2 % in the first nine months of 2010 , among other reasons because of a campaign business . In the laundry business area , Herby further expanded its campaign and listing business in France , generating growth of 15 % . The contribution of Volume Business to consolidated EBIT for the period ending 30 September 2010 fell minimally to EUR 2.8 million ( Q1-Q3_2009 EUR 2.9 million ) . Outlook annual results expected to exceed previous year By end-2010 the company expects turnover to slightly exceed 2009 levels for the comparable segments . For the year-end , we are including two nonrecurring effects , the rise in results in the fourth quarter will be relatively moderate compared with the rest of the year , as the first half included the proceeds from the sale of the Bathroom Furnishings division , and consolidated results will also be affected by currency hedging transactions . Excluding the possible currency effects , the Board of Management is confident that the annual result for 2010 will actually exceed the previous year 's level of EUR 3.1 million , which also included the results of the Bathroom Furnishings division . Additional information is available in the financial report for period ending 30 September 2010 .",-12.80423,-12.84239,False,False
"Independent Business Review recommends reduction of debt level The Management Board of Conergy AG has received a ` Final Draft ' of the independent business review from an audit firm commissioned in August 2010 . Conergy and its banks agreed upon this in the refinancing talks in July 2010 according to the adhoc release dated 29 July 2010 . The review concludes that Conergy AG 's debt-to-equity ratio is too high and deems a restructuring of the Company 's balance sheet necessary . Even though the final confirmation from the audit firm on the Company 's ability to refinance its loans beyond 31 December 2011 is yet outstanding , the Management Board believes that it is more likely than not that the maturity of the existing loans will be accelerated to 21 December 2010 as envisaged in this case . As further reported in the adhoc release dated 29 July 2010 , the financing banks had already declared their willingness in the context of an extension of the loans to jointly seek ways to adjust the liabilities side in the event that the maturity of the loans is accelerated . The Company is therefore in ongoing talks with the consortium of banks aimed at determining an appropriate debt-to-equity ratio for Conergy and defining suitable measures that will safeguard the Company 's future financing .",-11.37191,-10.77203,False,False
"Ad hoc announcement acc . to Section 15 of German Securities Trading Law ( WpHG ) CENTROTEC remains at record level after Q3 , with profitability significantly improved Brilon , November 11 , 2010 Record revenue of EUR 349.4 million was achieved in the first nine months of 2010 . This total represents growth of 6 % on the previous year , and also a higher level than in the previous record year of 2008 . Revenue growth was achieved in almost every major domestic and international market . The group further consolidated its strong market position in its core markets . Maintaining a trend stretching back over two years , it again significantly increased its share of the German heating market in Q3 . There was a substantial improvement in the profitability of the Gas Flue Systems segment . Marked catch-up effects in the Engineering Plastics area , combined with the Medical Technology area 's immunity to the crisis , led to an upgrading of the revenue forecast for the Medical Technology and Engineering Plastics segment . The above-average earnings performance reflects the steadily growing profitability of the CENTROTEC Group . EBITDA rose by 22 % to EUR 38.1 million ( previous year EUR 31.3 million ) . EBIT was up one-third to EUR 24.5 million . Earnings per share ( EPS ) almost matched the end figure for the previous record-breaking year 2008 , at EUR 1.06 ( previous year EUR -0.02 ) after only nine months . The underlying situation for CENTROTEC 's business remains positive , with average energy prices for the year well up on the prior-year level and further energy price rise forecast for the medium term . The CENTROTEC companies are ideally positioned in the global growth market for energy-saving solutions in buildings thanks to the strong market position they have now achieved . The ongoing strategy of innovation and systematic development of the product range , for instance through the addition of a market-leading range of heat pumps and the integrated energy roof system , continues to present fresh market opportunities . As a result of growing profitability , the earnings forecast for 2010 as a whole was again upgraded at the start of October . The company now expects revenue of EUR 480 , 500 million , higher EBIT of now EUR 36 , 37 million ( previously EUR 30 , 32 million ) and a further rise in earnings per share ( EPS ) to EUR 1.50 , 1.60 , the latter indicator already having been upgraded to EUR 1.30 , 1.40 from originally EUR 1.10 , 1.20 . CENTROTEC Sustainable AG CENTROTEC Sustainable AG and its subsidiaries enjoy a presence in over 50 different countries . The principal group companies are Wolf Heiztechnik , Brink Climate Systems and Ned Air in the Climate Systems segment , which have specialised in heating , climate control and ventilation technology e.g. in the form of solar thermal systems , heat pumps , CHP units , climate control and ventilation systems with heat recovery for residential and commercial buildings , as well as Ubbink and Centrotherm , which have focused on plastic gas flue and air ducting systems and solar system components in the Gas Flue Systems segment .

"Neumarkt , November 11 , 2010 , SDAX-listed Pfleiderer AG ( ISIN DE 996764749 ) posted revenue of 381.4 million euros in the third quarter of 2010 , which is an increase of 9.8 % compared to the prior-year period . Exchange-rate effects were responsible for approximately 6 percentage points of the increase , the rest was primarily due to higher prices . Despite the revenue growth compared with the third quarter of 2009 , gross profit decreased from 80.3 million euros to 76.5 million euros . The significant increase in raw-material prices , in particular for wood and chemicals ( glue and input materials ) , also had a negative impact on the gross margin . It fell to 20.1 percent ( Q3 2009 23.1 percent ) due to the 2.2 percentage-point increase in material expenses in relation to revenue . Compared with the first quarter of 2010 ( 58.1 percent ) , material expenses fell to 56.3 percent , however . The balance of other operating income and expenses of 4.1 million euros primarily comprises income from the retransfer of provisions for legal disputes ( 5.0 million euros ) and from the retransfer of provisions for property renovation ( 1.0 million euros ) , expenses reflect impairments of 2.0 million euros relating to the plant closure in Fostoria , Ohio , USA . Third-quarter EBITDA increased to 28.0 million euros , compared with 26.5 million euros in 2009 . The EBITDA margin in the third quarter of 2010 was thus 7.3 percent , compared with 7.6 percent in Q3 2009 . Positive exchange-rate effects , in particular from the Polish zloty and the Canadian dollar , contributed 1.5 million euros of total earnings . EBIT of minus 1.0 million euros was better than in the prior-year quarter ( minus 3.2 million euros ) . The net financial expense of 27.4 million euros includes an amount of approximately 1.6 million euros of interest expense for the recognition of accrued transaction costs for the Group 's refinancing . Furthermore , other financial expense of 7.2 million euros primarily reflects impairments on the valuation on the balance sheet date of loans denominated in foreign currencies ( 17.8 million euros ) as well as gains on mark-to-market valuations of exchange-rate hedges ( 10.2 million euros ) and interest-rate hedges ( 0.3 million euros ) . Due to the factors listed above , the result of continuing operations before taxes amounted to a loss of 28.3 million euros , compared with a loss of 14.1 million euros for the prior-year quarter . In the third quarter of this year , we recognized a deferred tax asset , which contributed to a net tax benefit of 0.4 million euros . Due to payments of taxes for prior periods , discontinued operations contributed a loss of 0.6 million euros to the overall loss for the period of 28.5 million euros , of which 1.7 million euros is attributable to minority interests . The statement of income also includes the claims of hybrid bondholders of 4.7 million euros . A loss of 31.5 million euros is therefore attributable to the shareholders of Pfleiderer AG , compared with a loss of 21.8 million euros for the third quarter of 2009 . This results in a basic loss per share from continuing operations of 54 euro cents , compared with a loss of 43 euro cents for the prior-year quarter . Compared with the previous quarter , net debt was reduced by 48.9 million euros to 914.5 million euros . This was primarily due to the more efficient management of current assets as well as exchange-rate effects ( 27.5 million euros ) . As already disclosed in a press release on October 11 , 2010 , no significant recovery of the market for raw particleboard is to be expected in the short term . In view of overcapacities in Western Europe , an adjustment of the product offering is therefore necessary . Pfleiderer is currently actively occupied with plans that could lead to the closure of further production capacities at the Ebersdorf and Nidda plants in Germany . Margins are also under pressure from major increases in raw-material costs , which can often only be passed on to customers after a certain time lag . An additional factor is that the economic situation in North America has not developed in line with our expectations . At present , therefore , we are examining various restructuring options . In combination with economic developments , those options could lead to impairment charges and restructuring expenses . Against this backdrop , we do not exclude the possibility that if there is no sustained improvement in the market situation , we may be unable to fulfill the financial covenants agreed upon with the banks in the future , and may have to resume negotiations . This would lead to credit lines becoming more expensive or even falling due . In the worst case , it might jeopardize the company 's continuing existence . We assume , however , that also in that case , we will be able to reach an agreement with the banks once again on the continuation of our financing .

"DF Deutsche Forfait AG publishes preliminary Q3 results and lowers guidance - Forfaiting volume up on the previous year but below expectations , Forfaiting market not yet benefiting from economic upturn Cologne , 12 November 2010 , In the first nine months of 2010 , DF Deutsche Forfait AG generated a consolidated profit of EUR 2.0 million ( previous year EUR 2.5 million ) . This figure falls short of the pro rata planning for the full year 2010 . For the current year , the Board of Management continues to expect a clearly positive result , which however will come in significantly below the forecast of EUR 4.2 million published in April . The forfaiting business and therefore gross result including financial results did not develop as planned . The main reason for this was the forfaiting volume rising by just 11 % to EUR 485.3 million in the first nine months of the year , a figure that is considerably below expectations . At the same time , the forfaiting margin dropped from 2.3 % to 1.9 % , following the anticipated trend . Overall , the gross result including financial results fell by EUR 0.6 million to EUR 9.3 million . This development contradicts the record results announced by the German export industry in the current year . However , DF Deutsche Forfait AG usually generates the majority of its forfaiting volume abroad . Regions important to the company such as Mexico have not yet benefited from the global economic upturn to the extent previously expected . DF Deutsche Forfait AG adjusted its sales structure due to the fundamental changes in the market after the financial crisis . The company established a new unit for the secondary market only , which focuses on maintaining and expanding networks of banks and forfaiting companies , essential for the placement of receivables . In addition , the controlling of the sales units and the marketing activities in the regional markets are being improved . DF Deutsche Forfait AG expects that these measures will help it achieve its target of significant growth in forfaiting volume and profit .

"Ad-hoc-Release , 12 November 2010 EADS Reports Nine-Month Results for 2010 , Significant order intake of EUR 57.7 billion driven by Airbus , Long Range production rate increases to 9 aircraft per month in Q1 2012 , Revenues of EUR 31.6 billion , EBIT * before one-off at EUR 0.8 billion , Net income EUR 198 million , Net Cash at EUR 10.3 billion better than expected , a key asset , Increase of Free Cash Flow guidance EADS ' ( stock exchange symbol EAD ) macro-economic and commercial environment continues to improve thanks to increasing aircraft demand . Institutional markets including helicopters , defense and public budgets have to be monitored . At the end of September , the order intake ( 4 ) of EUR 57.7 billion mirrors the improved momentum in commercial aviation . EADS ' order book of more than EUR 426 billion provides a solid platform for future deliveries . EADS ' revenues amount to EUR 31.6 billion . The EBIT * before one-off of EUR 0.8 billion benefited from the underlying performance in Airbus legacy programs and other core business activities . EBIT * amounted to EUR 784 million . The Net Cash position of EUR 10.3 billion is better than expected thanks to better cash performance and favourable phasing . It is a key asset to foster future growth . ` The commercial aviation sector continues its ascent which starts to be reflected in the nine-month results . Within this improving environment , the A380 production is visibly progressing and manufacturing of the A350 has begun . I want to express our gratitude to the A400M Customer Nations who have supported us in reaching an agreement ' , said Louis Gallois , CEO of EADS . ` At the same time , budget reviews in our home countries are not yet fully completed , we therefore remain attentive to challenges which could arise for our business with government customers . Looking forward , beyond 2011 the upturn in the commercial aircraft business should drive the profitability improvement of the Group . In the mid-term , at the current exchange rates , Airbus should significantly improve its underlying profitability thanks to better volume , pricing and further economic improvement of the A380 performance . ' In the first nine months , EADS ' revenues increased to EUR 31.6 billion ( 9m 2009 EUR 29.7 billion ) thanks to growth from both volume and mix effects across core businesses . Physical deliveries remained at a high level with 380 aircraft at Airbus Commercial , 367 helicopters at Eurocopter and the 38th consecutive successful Ariane 5 launch . The percentage-of-completion methodology was resumed on the A400M program . Until the end of September , based on the allocation of internal milestones , around EUR 500 million in revenues were booked on the program . The Customer Nations and EADS have concluded negotiations on the overall A400M discussions . The FY 2009 A400M provision calculation remains valid . Government payments are more back-loaded than expected after the signature of the principle agreement in March 2010 . Negotiations on the export levy facility ( ELF ) scheme are expected to be finalized before the end of the year . Once parliamentary approvals are obtained , the agreement will be binding . In the meantime , the A400M flight test program is progressing better than expected with the fourth aircraft due to join the flight test campaign before year-end . EBIT * before one-off ( adjusted EBIT * ) , an indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding non-recurring charges or profits caused by movements in provisions or foreign exchange impacts , stood at EUR 0.8 billion ( 9m 2009 EUR 1.7 billion ) for EADS and around EUR 0.3 billion for Airbus . It benefited from good underlying performance of Airbus legacy programs and core business activities in the other Divisions . As expected , A380 continues to weigh significantly on the underlying performance . Compared to the first nine months of 2009 , EBIT * before one-off was mainly weighed down by the deterioration of hedge rates and higher investment in Research and Development . EADS ' reported EBIT * stood at EUR 784 million ( 9m 2009 EUR 1,089 million ) . Net Income amounted to EUR 198 million ( 9m 2009 EUR 291 million ) , or earnings per share of EUR 0.24 ( earnings per share 9m 2009 EUR 0.36 ) . The finance result amounts to EUR -452 million ( 9m 2009 EUR -615 million ) . The interest result of EUR -176 million ( 9m 2009 EUR -89 million ) reflects the decline in interest rates on the financial markets . The other financial result amounts to EUR -276 million ( 9m 2009 EUR -526 million ) . The improvement year-on-year is due to a positive revaluation of the Group 's U.S. dollar and GBP cash assets and the revaluation of financial instruments . Self-financed Research and Development ( R and D ) expenses reached EUR 2,038 million ( 9m 2009 EUR 1,834 million ) , driven by increases at Airbus due to a ramp-up in A350 XWB activity as well as increasing product investment at Cassidian for the Unmanned Aerial Systems ( UAS ) and Systems businesses and at Eurocopter across the product range . Going forward R and D expenses should increase at Airbus , Eurocopter and Cassidian . Free Cash Flow before customer financing of EUR 882 million ( 9m 2009 EUR -892 million ) has benefited from good commercial order intake , a high volume of commercial deliveries including 14 A380 as well as favourable phasing . Receipts from governments for development programs roughly compensate payment delays . At Airbus , inventories remained stable in the first nine months of 2010 . The nine-month results of 2009 included a ramp-up on the A380 but a low level of A380 deliveries as well as a mismatch between production and delivery rates for both single aisle and long range aircraft . The inflow of advances linked to Airbus commercial activity was higher than one year ago , reflecting the increase in deliveries and commercial aircraft orders . This positive effect was more than offset by the lower inflows from Astrium and Cassidian . In the first nine months , the net customer financing outflow was lower than expected at around EUR -90 million due to a combination of appetite from lessors and banking market recovery . The third quarter included the sell down of three A320 operating leases . Free Cash Flow after customer financing amounted to EUR 791 million ( 9m 2009 EUR -1,182 million ) . EADS ' Net Cash position amounted to EUR 10.3 billion ( year-end 2009 EUR 9.8 billion ) after a EUR 300 million contribution to pension fund assets . It continues to provide a solid foundation for the Group 's operational needs as well as future growth . The order intake of EADS significantly increased to EUR 57.7 billion compared to one year ago ( 9m 2009 EUR 24.6 billion ) mainly due to higher commercial aircraft orders . By the end of September 2010 , EADS ' order book stood at a robust EUR 426.4 billion ( year-end 2009 EUR 389.1 billion ) , mainly reflecting increases at Airbus and Astrium . The Airbus Commercial order book benefited from a positive revaluation impact of around EUR 18 billion due to the closing spot rate of the U.S. dollar that has significantly strengthened since year-end . The defense order book stood at EUR 56.4 billion ( year-end 2009 EUR 57.3 billion ) . At the end of September 2010 , EADS ' workforce consisted of 120,580 employees ( year-end 2009 119,506 ) . Outlook In 2010 , Airbus gross orders should be up to 500 thanks to the commercial aircraft upturn and Airbus deliveries should be slightly more than 500 . EADS ' guidance is based on an assumption of EUR1 = $ 1.35 for the Q4 2010 average rate and year-end closing spot rate . EADS revenues should be more than EUR 44 billion . At slightly more than 500 deliveries , EADS confirms its EBIT * before one-off guidance at around EUR 1.2 billion . Going forward the EBIT * performance of EADS will be dependent on the Group 's ability to execute on the A400M , A380 and A350XWB programs , in line with the commitments made to its customers . Using the above exchange rate assumptions , EADS increases its EBIT * guidance to at least EUR 1.1 billion . EADS is also increasing its Free Cash Flow guidance . Provided a sustainable year-end cash inflow of institutional and government business , the Free Cash Flow before customer financing should be around EUR 1 billion and Free Cash Flow after customer financing should be above EUR 800 million compared to the previously expected free cash outflow of around EUR -600 million . * EADS uses EBIT pre goodwill impairment and exceptionals as a key indicator of its economic performance . The term ` exceptionals ' refers to such items as depreciation expenses of fair value adjustments relating to the EADS merger , the Airbus Combination and the formation of MBDA , as well as impairment charges thereon . EADS is a global leader in aerospace , defense and related services . In 2009 , the Group , comprising Airbus , Astrium , Cassidian and Eurocopter , generated revenues of EUR 42.8 billion and employed a workforce of more than 119,000 .",-4.446195,-4.673437,False,False
"Berlin , 12 November 2010 , Prime Standard-listed MAGIX AG from Berlin ( ISIN DE0007220782 ) has achieved record revenues according to preliminary , unaudited figures in the financial year 2009_2010 . Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) rose considerably compared to the previous year , thus clearly exceeding expectations . Due to the positive development of business the Executive Board expects further increases in revenues and results for the financial year 2010_2011 , which started in October . With EUR 37.1 million , the MAGIX group 's revenues reached a new record in 2009_2010 , and thus met the last revenue forecast of the Executive Board ( EUR 37 to 37.5 million ) . Compared to last year 's figure of EUR 34.8 million this corresponds to a growth rate of 7 % . While retail sales continued to be slow , growth continued in the portal division . Sales in the OEM and Professional divisions also experienced growth . The revenue increase was accompanied by a drop in the costs of goods as a result of which the gross margin rose considerably . With moderately higher operative costs and slightly decreasing depreciations , the EBIT rose from EUR 3.1 million in the previous year to EUR 5.6 million ( +81 % ) . Thus , the positive expectations for results of the board ( EUR 4 to 4.5 million ) were exceeded considerably . The EBIT margin rose from 9 to 15 % . Revenues are predicted to rise by 7-14 % during the current financial year . At the same time the Board expects startup costs for HR , marketing and development in order to progress the expansion of B2B business on the one side and to further internationalize the product portfolio on the other , thus ensuring a growth that exceeds the financial year . As a consequence , a moderate rise in EBIT up to EUR 6 million is expected . Thorough information concerning the preliminary , unaudited figures from the 2009_2010 fiscal year will be released on Wednesday , 17 November 2010 in an online presentation hosted by the company 's board members at www.magix.com . The company will publish its annual report on 31 January , 2011 .",5.610638,4.889407,True,True

"In the first six months of fiscal year 2010_2011 ( as of September 30 , 2010 ) , most New Value portfolio companies profited from a friendlier economic environment and the recovery of sales markets . This positive development is not yet directly reflected in New Value 's half-year results . Equity value in terms of net asset value ( NAV ) totaled CHF 71.4 million . NAV per share fell 1 % from CHF 24.27 at the beginning of the period on March 31 , 2010 , to CHF 24.12 .

Further New Value developed its growth companies and prepared them for new growth . Operational advances by Silentsoft SA , Swiss Medical Solution AG and QualiLife AG led to upward valuations of their positions totaling CHF 0.85 million . With support from New Value , FotoDesk Group AG entered the business printing segment and strengthened its market position by acquiring the online photo and business printing divisions of netservice . cc media AG . This increase in value was offset by value adjustments of CHF 1.64 million for Mycosym International AG due to weaker than expected performance . Overall , in the first half of 2010_2011 ( as of September 30 , 2010 ) , New Value recorded a loss of CHF 1.99 million ( previous year profit of CHF 10.17 million after the sale of the interest in Meyer Burger_3S ) .

"NEWS RELEASE INTERNATIONAL MINERALS SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH CHINESE COMPANY FOR FINANCING AND CONSTRUCTION OF RIO BLANCO AND GABY GOLD PROJECTS IN ECUADOR Scottsdale , Arizona , November 15 , 2010 , International Minerals Corporation ( Toronto and Swiss stock exchanges ` IMZ ' or ` the Company ' ) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed Memoranda of Understanding ( ` MOUs ' ) with a Chinese company , China CAMC Engineering Co. , Ltd. ( ` China Co. ' ) for the financing and construction of IMZ 's Rio Blanco and Gaby gold projects in Ecuador ( the ` Projects ' ) . IMZ currently holds a 100 % interest in the Rio Blanco project and variable interests in the mineral concessions comprising the Gaby project , ranging from 51 % to 100 % . Based on the terms of the MOUs for the Projects ( see page 2 for details ) , China Co. would . Arrange the required production debt financing for the Projects through one or more Chinese financial institutions ( the ` Lender ' ) , and Construct and deliver turn-key mining operations for the Projects , based on an industry-standard Engineering , Procurement and Construction ( EPC ) contract . The transaction remains subject to a number of conditions , including ( a ) the receipt of the necessary permits for construction of mining and processing facilities at the Projects in Ecuador , ( b ) Canadian regulatory approvals , and ( c ) the completion of definitive documentation providing for the production financing and EPC contract , the latter with a targeted completion date of January 31 , 2011 . IMZ 's President and CEO , Stephen Kay stated ` We are very pleased to sign these MOUs with China Co , who have a well-established reputation for designing , engineering and constructing high-quality , turn-key industrial projects worldwide . We look forward to working with China Co. to expedite the financing , construction and commencement of production at the Rio Blanco and Gaby deposits . ' The key aspects of the MOUs are summarized below , with the final amount of financing required for the Projects remaining subject to final engineering and design work by China Co. The projected time-line for construction of the Projects is dependent on several factors . At Rio Blanco , a feasibility study has already been completed ( February 2006 ) and detailed engineering is 90 % complete . Approval of the Environmental Impact Study ( ` EIS ' ) for construction of a mine was well-advanced prior to the suspension of all exploration activities in Ecuador by the Ecuadorian government in March 2008 . The EIS approval process is expected to resume shortly and it is hoped that approvals can be received by IMZ in the first half of 2011 . It is anticipated that the earliest that production could commence at Rio Blanco would be late in 2013 or early 2014 and is dependent upon the negotiation of a production contract for the project , as required under the Ecuadorian Mining Law . At Gaby , although a preliminary feasibility study has been completed by IMZ with an estimated 6.9 million gold ounces in the measured and indicated resource category ( 4.1 million ounces attributable to IMZ ) , the time line to production will be longer than Rio Blanco because a feasibility study remains to be completed before permitting can commence .

In the Interim report Neo Industrial wrote in near term outlook that the production of Valkeakoski special fiber plant will start its activities during this year and that the first deliveries of fire retardant fiber are planned to deliver in December . Poor harvest of cotton and specially the market growth of China but also increase in common market demand of viscose fiber bring good possibilities to the success of the products that Valkeakoski special fiber plant will produce . However , at the same time the explosive growth within very short time in the demand of the main raw material of Valkeakoski , dissolving pulp , has brought challenges to the timetable of the production startup , At least the raw materials for three production months are needed to be secured before the production startup is reasonable . When the usage of raw materials for three months is secured the constant continuation of 24_7 process can be ensured . All needed raw materials for three months constant production has not been confirmed yet and therefore production startup will probably not happen during December . This means that probably the first customer deliveries will be made in 2011 . The preparations relating starting the production machinery will be continued .

The primary objective of the trial , to assess the success of a colonoscopy procedure in comparison to midazolam ( the gold-standard agent ) , was met , and showed success rates of 97.5 % in the lowest , 95.0 % at the middle and 92.5 % at the highest dose regimen with Remimazolam , compared to 75 % with Midazolam . The primary endpoint was a composite consisting of sedation sufficient to initiate and complete the procedure , no mechanical or manual ventilation and no rescue sedation . In addition , the results show that Remimazolam patients recovered faster from their procedure , being fully alert within 13.3 minutes in the lowest , 11.3 minutes at the middle and 13.6 minutes at the highest dose regimen , compared to 15.2 minutes with Midazolam after the last dose of study drug . PAION 's current interpretation is that the unexpected relatively short wake up times of Midazolam are attributable to the fact that 25 % of the midazolam patients did not respond to treatment and therefore received Propofol as a rescue medication quite early which is known as a short acting compound . Therefore they did not receive ` a typical ' midazolam dose to allow accumulation resulting in a longer offset times . This is the third clinical trial showing clinically relevant improvements of Remimazolam over Midazolam .",0.3937004,0.1525598,True,True

"Hamburg , Germany , 19 November 2010 . Joyou Group ( ` Joyou ' ) intends to set up a new plant for ceramic sanitary ware products , such as basins , toilets , and similar ceramic products . The investment for the project amounts to approximately RMB 350 million ( EUR 38.8 million ) for the production facilities and a further RMB 70 million ( EUR 7.8 million ) for working capital which will be funded from operations . Parts of Joyou AG 's proceeds from its IPO in March 2010 will be used to finance the project . The project has been approved by the supervisory board and commencement of operations is expected for the second quarter of 2011 . As the Chinese economy continues its high growth and rapid urbanization path , demand for ceramic sanitary ware products continues to increase . In part this increase is also due to the strong adoption of Western urban living styles and increased income per capita . Joyou currently sells ceramic sanitary ware products under the Joyou brand , however , production of such products is at present outsourced to third-party manufacturers . By bringing in-house this ceramics manufacturing capability , Joyou believes it will gain better quality and cost control , and hence be able to provide improved service to customers . Moreover , this will also significantly increase Joyou 's gross margins compared to the current outsourcing strategy . A further goal is to increase Joyou 's success in selling to the project business segment , such as new residential , office , or hotel developments , where purchases are normally made directly from the manufacturer . The new production site , which will include two new factory workshops , will be located in Meiyu Industrial Park , Luncang Town , Nan ` an City , Fujian Province , in the PRC , on a land plot of approximately 140,000 sqm . In the first phase after commencement of operations , the production capacity of the plant is expected to reach about 1.8 million , 2 million units per year . During the preparations for its IPO , Joyou still envisaged the acquisition of an existing ceramic sanitary ware company . However , after evaluating all available opportunities , management came to the conclusion that building of new production facilities is the preferable solution .",-1.272378,0.1718146,True,True

We will change the workload associated with long-haul flights . By limiting participation in time-difference flights , we can reduce the load on personnel , ' says Finnair 's President and CEO Mika Vehviläinen . Negotiations and mediation relating to the employment terms and conditions of Finnair 's cabin staff ended early this morning . During the process , no significant progress was achieved . The National Conciliator did not make a settlement proposal , so a strike of cabin staff began today at 13.00 . ` This negotiation process has been frustrating and we are unsure as to the motives guiding the employees ' representatives in this process .

"Ad-hoc-release , 1 December 2010 Airbus offers new fuel saving engine options for A320 Family Customers will benefit from up to 15 percent reduction in fuel consumption Airbus has decided to offer for its best-selling A320 Family new fuel saving engines as an option . Airlines have the choice between CFM International 's LEAP-X engine and Pratt and Whitney 's PurePower PW1100G engine . Known as the A320neo , this new engine option also incorporates fuel-saving large wing tip devices called Sharklets . Airbus will start deliveries of the A320neo Family in spring 2016 . The A320neo will not only deliver significant fuel savings of up to 15 percent , which represents up to 3,600 tonnes of CO2 savings annually per A320neo . In addition , A320neo customers will benefit from a double-digit reduction in NOx emissions , reduced engine noise , lower operating costs and up to 500nm ( 950 km ) more range or two tonnes more payload . As new engine technologies become available in the middle of this decade , Airbus is committed to providing its customers with the latest and most eco-efficient technologies to continuously improve aircraft performance and airline operations while reducing the environmental impact . Airbus sees a market potential of 4,000 A320neo Family aircraft over the next 15 years . ` We are confident that the A320neo will be a great success across all markets and with all types of operators , offering them maximum benefit with minimum change . We are leveraging a reliable , mature aircraft and are making it even more efficient and environmentally friendly , ' said Tom Enders , Airbus President and CEO . Over the past months , Airbus has taken the time to carefully assess and weigh up the benefits of the A320neo business case with the allocation of the highly skilled engineering resources needed while at the same time securing the engineering skills required on other Airbus aircraft programs . ` Finding the necessary resources for the A320neo was n't exactly a walk in the park , ' Enders added . ` The enabler was to devise a stringent phasing of critical engineering assets throughout our various development programs and to optimise the management and organization of all our programs and R and T projects . Our international engineering centres , suppliers and partners play a big role in this . ' Today 's A320neo announcement follows the approval given by the Board of Directors of EADS , Airbus ' shareholder company . The new engine option is offered on the A321 , A320 and A319 models which will require limited modifications , primarily to the wing and pylon areas . The A320neo will have over 95 percent airframe commonality with the standard A320 Family . The unique Airbus operational commonality enables operators of several Airbus Family types to continue to benefit from lower pilot and maintenance training costs . Airbus launched its new ` Sharklet ' large wingtip devices , specially designed to enhance the eco-efficiency and payload-range performance of the A320 Family . Offered as a forward-fit option , Sharklets are expected to result in at least 3.5 percent lower fuel burn over longer sectors . The A320 will be the first model fitted with Sharklets , which will be delivered around the end of 2012 , to be followed by the other A320 Family models from 2013 . The A320 Family is recognized as the benchmark single-aisle aircraft family . With over 6,700 aircraft sold , and more than 4,400 aircraft delivered to some 310 customers and operators worldwide , it is the world 's best-selling single-aisle aircraft family . With 99.7 per cent reliability and extended servicing periods , the A320 Family has the lowest operating costs of any single aisle aircraft . * * * EADS is a global leader in aerospace , defense and related services .

"The insolvency administrator dealing with the bankruptcy estate of Qimonda AG , Dr. Michael Jaffé , has filed an action in the District Court Munich I seeking a declaratory judgment against Infineon in an unspecified amount . The action asserts that , in connection with the carve-out of the memory business to Qimonda AG , Infineon utilized a previously formed shell company and ` economically re-established ' this company through the transfer of the memory business . The action further asserts that Infineon neglected to provide the company register with the declaration required by German company law in these circumstances and that , as a consequence of the alleged breach of this register-related legal formality , Infineon is obliged to refund to Qimonda the amount by which the actual company assets of Qimonda at the time insolvency proceedings were opened were less than Qimonda 's equity capital ( i. e , a liability for impairment of capital ) . The action seeks to establish a basic obligation to pay on the part of Infineon , as the administrator does not currently consider himself to be in a position to put a concrete figure on the amount of his alleged claim . Infineon regards the action as without merit , based on the expert opinions of a prominent law firm and a respected professor of jurisprudence . The requirements for the ` economic re-establishment ' of a shell company were not present in these circumstances . The contribution of the memory business to Qimonda AG was carried out in compliance with all register-related requirements and no objection was raised by the competent court at the time of the carve-out . Even if the requirements for the ` economic re-establishment ' were present , the legal consequences asserted are entirely disproportionate as the action merely claims the omission of a register-related formality . Infineon had refuted the circumstances alleged and the legal consequences deriving from these already before the action was brought and intends to defend itself vigorously against this action through all stages of the proceedings . 02.12.2010",2.21496,1.029461,True,True

"NEWS RELEASE International Minerals Announces Further Drill Results from Goldfield Project , Nevada . Results Include Gold Intercepts of 5.2 m at 15.3 g_t and 3.8 m at 10.8 g_t Scottsdale , Arizona , December 6 , 2010 , International Minerals Corporation ( Toronto and Swiss stock exchanges ` IMZ ' ) reports additional results from its ongoing reverse circulation ( ` RC ' ) drilling program at the Goldfield Main deposit at its 100%-held Goldfield gold project in southern Nevada . Highlights of these new results include the following drill intercepts ( representing estimated true widths in meters ( 'm ' ) and uncut gold grades in grams per tonne ( ` g_t ' ) . * 36.6 m at 1.6 g_t in 2010-015 * 6.1 m at 6.7 g_t in 2010-033 * 5.2 m at 15.3 g_t in 2010-035 * 3.8 m at 10.8 g_t in 2010-035 * 10.7 m at 3.23 g_t in 2010-085 * 9.2 m at 2.1 g_t in 2010-087 As in previously reported drill results , significant widths and gold grades were also encountered in drilling through the backfilled areas of the historical mine workings suggesting that good-grade material was used to backfill those mined-out areas . IMZ is constructing a detailed computer model of these backfilled workings in order to quantify their volume and grade as they may have a significant positive impact on the economics of a potential mining operation at the Goldfield Main deposit . Highlights of the results from drill intersections in backfilled areas are shown below * 11.3 m at 2.6 g_t in 2010-025 * 9.8 m at 3.7 g_t in 2010-035 * 3.8 m at 24.5 g_t in 2010-035 * 5.2 m at 12.3 g_t in 2010-035 Assay results for all 28 RC drill holes totaling 5,540 m reported in this news release are summarized in Appendix 1 and are shown on the plan map in Appendix 2 ( Click here to view full release with Appendices ) . IMZ has now reported drill results for a total of 86 RC drill holes totaling 17,575 m. See also IMZ 's previous news releases of August 25 and October 7 , 2010 for the previously-reported 58 drill holes at the Goldfield Main deposit . Goldfield Main Deposit The Goldfield Main deposit is one of three principal mineralized areas that have been evaluated on the Goldfield property over the past two decades . The other deposits are Gemfield and McMahon Ridge ( See map , Appendix 2 ) Gold mineralization at the Goldfield Main deposit occurs primarily as narrow , high-grade veins , within tabular , gently-dipping , lower-grade mineralized zones . The majority of gold produced historically from the Goldfield district was mined from these high-grade veins but more recent open-pit production was sourced from the near-surface lower grade mineralized zones . Reported production from the district from 1903 to 1960 is estimated to be 4.2 million ounces of gold at an average grade of approximately 18 g_t . These new results continue to confirm that the mineralized bodies at the Goldfield Main deposit extend down-dip to the east , with many of the assay results indicating gold grades significantly higher than the average grade of the current mineral resource estimate ( see below ) . The historical underground workings extend up to an additional 300-500m east of the eastern extent of the current IMZ drilling program ( see Appendix 2 ) , indicating the potential for a significant increase in mineral resources at the Goldfield Main deposit . Mined-out areas ( generally 2-5m wide ) encountered in the drilling program ( designated as ` Voids ' in Appendix 1 ) are intercepts of old mine workings . Goldfield Project , Initial Drill Program This initial RC drilling program ( expected to total approximately 20,000 m in 93 drill holes ) is designed to both increase the confidence level of the mineral resource base at the Goldfield Main deposit as well as expand the existing resource base . IMZ expects to announce an updated mineral resource estimate for the Goldfield Main deposit before the end of the first calendar quarter of 2011 . A core rig will start drilling soon in the Goldfield Main area in order to ( a ) obtain samples for metallurgical testwork , ( b ) ` twin ' ( duplicate ) several RC holes in order to compare and confirm assay results and geological interpretation , and ( c ) to verify that IMZ 's identification in certain drill holes of backfilled material from old mine workings is correct as it is often difficult to distinguish between friable , or highly broken , in-situ rock and backfilled material . In other parts of the Goldfield District ( outside of the three principal deposits ) three additional drill targets have been developed . Approximately 5,000 m of RC drilling is planned for these areas in the coming months . Goldfield Project , NI 43-101 Mineral Resources The current NI 43-101 compliant independent mineral resource estimates for the Goldfield Main deposit are . * 242,000 ounces of Indicated resources , contained in 6.0 million tonnes ( ` Mt ' ) at a grade of 1.2 g_t gold , and * 80,000 ounces of Inferred resources , contained in 1.9 Mt at a grade of 1.3 g_t gold . Combined with the Gemfield and McMahon Ridge deposits , the current total gold resource estimate for the overall Goldfield project comprises . * 1,068,000 ounces of Measured and Indicated resources , contained in 28.8 Mt at an average grade of 1.2 g_t gold , and * 105,000 ounces of Inferred resources , contained in 3.0 Mt at an average grade of 1.1 g_t gold . The cut-off grade used was 0.34 g_t gold for all three deposits at Goldfield . Mineral resource estimates at the Goldfield project have been conducted separately for the Goldfield Main deposit and the Gemfield_McMahon Ridge deposits at Goldfield Main the mineral resources were estimated in 2002 by Mine Development Associates , with Scott Hardy , P. Eng , Neil Prenn , P. Eng and Steve Ristorcelli , R.P. Geo as the Qualified Persons ( ` QP 's ' ) , at Gemfield and McMahon Ridge the mineral resources were estimated in 2005 by Watts , Griffis and McOuat , with John R. Sullivan , P. Geo as the QP . General Sample preparation and analytical work for the Goldfield drilling program were carried out by Inspectorate Labs in Sparks , Nevada , an ISO 9001 2008 certified laboratory which employs industry-standard analytical methods . As part of IMZ 's QA_QC protocol , standard samples and blanks were inserted into the sample processing stream at a rate of one per 10 samples . Duplicate and alternate laboratory check samples also form part of this sampling protocol .

"Press Release Orascom Development plans to launch a public tender offer to the remaining minority shareholders in Orascom Hotels and Development S.A.E. ( ` OHD ' ) ( the ` Tender Offer ' ) and intends to delist OHD from the Egyptian Stock Exchange Altdorf_Cairo , 8 December 2010 , Upon request by the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority ( ` EFSA ' ) and due to the absence of any squeeze out procedure under Egyptian Capital Market law , Orascom Development Holding AG ( ` Orascom Development ' or ` the Company ' ) announces its plans to launch the Tender Offer to the remaining minority shareholders of OHD . In the Tender Offer the Company intends to acquire 8,757,686 shares of OHD ( ` OHD Shares ' ) , representing 3.86 % of the outstanding OHD Shares . For Egyptian regulatory reasons , this number includes 4,797,204 OHD Shares , the economic interest of which is already held by the Company and for which no consideration will be paid in the Tender Offer . Orascom Development expects to launch the Tender Offer in the second half of December 2010 , subject to the final EFSA approval and other Egyptian regulatory requirements . The Tender Offer will remain open for 20 business days from the date of announcement . The Tender Offer consideration will include , at the option of OHD shareholders , either cash or Orascom Development 's Egyptian Depositary Receipts ( ` EDRs ' ) . The price offered in the Tender Offer will be determined prior to launch and after reviewing valuation reports presented by two independent fairness opinion providers . The aggregate purchase price in cash or EDRs is expected to be announced on or around the 20th December 2010 . With a view to ensuring delivery of registered shares of Orascom Development ( ` ODH Shares ' ) underlying the EDRs to the remaining shareholders upon closing of the Tender Offer , Orascom Development has entered into a securities lending agreement with its major shareholder Samih O. Sawiris . Under this agreement , Samih O. Sawiris has agreed to lend to Orascom Development up to 1,286,353 ODH Shares free of charge . This number serves to cover all of the 3.86 % or more OHD Shares being subject of the Tender Offer depending on the final pricing and swap ratio . Given the holding of economic interest in 4,797,204 OHD Shares by the Company , , for which no consideration will be paid , the maximum number of ODH Shares needed for the Tender Offer will be based on only 3,960,482 OHD Shares . This maximum number is therefore significantly less and should end up in using less than half of the ODH Shares borrowed by the Company . Orascom Development is under an obligation to redeliver the ODH Shares borrowed at the latest ten business days after its annual shareholder meeting scheduled in May 2011 . The issuance of new ODH Shares will be proposed to be out of authorized capital to be approved at such shareholder meeting . After completion of the Tender Offer , Orascom Development intends to delist OHD completely from the Egyptian Exchange ( EGX ) .",-0.2568789,-0.5354066,False,False

"Deutsche Börse AG is expecting a non-cash impairment charge on intangible assets in the range of EUR450 million relating to the International Securities Exchange ( ISE ) for financial year 2010 . The impairment charge will be partially offset by a reduction in deferred tax liabilities relating to ISE . All in all , the company anticipates that the impairment will lead to a reduction in IFRS consolidated net income for 2010 in the range of EUR220 million . The figures are subject to preparation and auditing of the annual financial statements 2010 . The impairment does not affect key credit metrics , such as the interest coverage ratio or net tangible equity . ISE continues to operate profitably . In addition , Deutsche Börse AG plans to transfer its remaining shares ( 49 % ) in Clearstream International S.A. , which it did not yet transfer as part of the implementation of the Clearstream interim holding structure in 2009 , to Clearstream Holding AG at fiscal book value by the end of the year . The transfer does not affect consolidated earnings in accordance with IFRS . In the financial statement prepared in accordance with German GAAP ( Handelsgesetzbuch , HGB ) this step will have a positive impact on earnings of around EUR440 million . The measure has no effect on the strong financial position of the Clearstream subgroup or the integrated business model of Deutsche Börse Group . In the first nine months of 2010 the Company generated cash flow from operating activities of EUR675 .5 million ( Q1-3_2009 EUR592 .8 million ) . The Company also anticipates a significant positive cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter since the impairment in connection with ISE is a non-cash item . The strong liquidity situation underscores Deutsche Börse AG 's ability to pay a stable dividend compared to the previous year ( 2009 EUR2 .10 ) . Deutsche Börse AG 's Supervisory Board will discuss the dividend proposal for financial year 2010 with the presentation of preliminary results in February 2011 . The Company confirms that costs for 2010 will be considerably lower compared to the original forecast . With operating costs of around EUR935 million and volume-related costs of approximately EUR215 million , total costs for the current financial year are expected to be around EUR1 ,150 million before costs for efficiency programs and the ISE impairment . In 2011 the Company expects a further improvement of operating costs by around EUR60 million due to the ongoing efficiency measures . The savings will be partly offset by a cost increase from inflation of around EUR20 million , along with a further rise in expenditures for organic growth initiatives and infrastructure by around 1_3 ( EUR30 million ) to approximately EUR120 million . The Company expects a rise in volume-related costs , which are considerably influenced by Clearstream , to around EUR235 to EUR255 million . This increase is attributable in particular to the anticipated growth at Clearstream . This means that the total cost forecast for 2011 is around EUR1 ,160 to EUR1 ,180 million , before costs for efficiency programs of approximately EUR30 million . 10.12.2010",1.024127,0.8139034,True,True

"Wiesbaden , December 10 , 2010 Impairment of Oglesby , IL cement plant , EU Antitrust Proceedings Our jointly controlled entity RC Lonestar Inc. in the U.S. resolved today to write down the book value of property , plant and equipment located at the Oglesby , Illinois cement plant and consisting of the facility 's production related assets . Manufacturing activity at the plant , which used to have a production capacity of 0.7 million tons of cement , had been temporarily ceased effective December 1 , 2008 , under the assumption that production would resume within the near term . Based upon the lack of improvement in the economic conditions of the Midwest market area since this date , the company does not expect to resume production at Oglesby for several years , which means indefinitely in time . These circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the production related assets is impaired . However , the facility will continue to operate as a distribution terminal and the market will be served by optimizing the utilization of the company 's Indiana ( Greencastle ) and Missouri ( Selma , Cape Girardeau ) plants , with no impact on the ability to attend to customers and on revenues from operating activities . The Supervisory Board of Dyckerhoff AG , during today 's meeting , agreed to mothball the production facility indefinitely in time and took note of the related impairment . The relevant impact in the consolidated financial statements can be estimated at EUR 48.3 million ( 1 ) on profit for the year and EUR 49.3 million ( 2 ) on equity . The impairment charge is a non-cash item and therefore it does not affect the expected operating cash flow for the financial year 2010 and the net financial position of the group . A similar press release is being issued by the parent Buzzi Unicem SpA , with indication of the relevant impact on its consolidated financial statements . Furthermore , our controlling shareholder Buzzi Unicem SpA received a notification from the European Commission informing about its decision to initiate proceedings vis - à - vis several companies , including Buzzi Unicem SpA and its controlled European subsidiaries , inter alia Dyckerhoff AG , operating in the cement sector in several European countries , aimed to ascertain the possible violation of art . 101 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union and of art . 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area . In particular , the Commission is willing to conduct investigations in order to ascertain the possible existence of restrictions to the trades between several Members of the European Economic Area ( EEA ) and towards the EEA , of market division , of price coordination and of other potentially anticompetitive practices in the market for cement and other related products . The opening of the proceedings represents the beginning of a phase in which Buzzi Unicem SpA shall have the right to defend itself before the Commission and has a preliminary character also for the Commission the initiation , therefore , does not mean that the Commission has any conclusive proof on the existence of a violation . Buzzi Unicem SpA , to its knowledge , deems that no evidence exists to indicate a hypothetical infringement of the antitrust laws .

The amount of loan is now approximately EUR 7.0 million . KCR Management Oy is owned by the executives who belonged to the Group Extended Management Team upon the establishment of KCR Management Oy . Members of the Board of Directors of Konecranes Plc are not shareholders in KCR Management Oy . According to the agreements governing KCR Management Oy , KCR Management Oy has an obligation to repay the loan granted by Konecranes Plc prematurely in case the share price of Konecranes Plc other than temporarily exceeds a certain level determined in the agreements . This condition has now been met . The Board of Directors of Konecranes Plc has decided that the loan will be repaid through a share swap whereby Konecranes Plc acquires all the shares in KCR Management Oy . To implement the share swap , the Board of Directors of Konecranes Plc has decided on a directed share issue in which the Company offers , in derogation from the shareholders ' pre-emptive subscription rights , a maximum total of 281,007 new Konecranes shares to the shareholders of KCR Management Oy against share consideration ( Share Swap ) . In the Share Swap , the shareholders of KCR Management Oy convey the KCR Management Oy shares they hold and receive new Konecranes Plc shares in return . In this arrangement , all the shares in KCR Management Oy will be transferred to Konecranes Plc. . Through KCR Management Oy , the Company will also receive 517,696 own Konecranes Plc shares as well as the Company 's loan receivable from KCR Management Oy . Afterwards the intention is to merge KCR Management Oy with Konecranes Plc through a subsidiary merger . In this connection the loan granted to KCR Management Oy will be set off and the Konecranes Plc shares held by KCR Management Oy will transfer to the Company 's direct ownership . When the Share Swap is executed the Konecranes Group executives ' previously indirect share ownership will become a direct ownership in Konecranes Plc. . The number of new shares to be given in the Share Swap has been determined on the basis of KCR Management Oy 's net assets and calculated by using the trade volume weighted average quotation of the Konecranes Plc share on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd on 13 December 2010 , both with respect to the issued new shares and to the shares in Konecranes Plc that KCR Management Oy owns . The new shares are subject to the transfer restriction determined by the Board of Directors in May 2009 and expiring on 1 November 2012 . The new Konecranes Plc shares to be given in the Share Swap are entitled to carry shareholder rights in the Company after the new shares have been entered into the Trade Register . The new shares will be registered on the subscriber 's book-entry account and will be applied for public trading on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Oy after their Trade Register entry , around week 3 in 2011 . The decision on the Share Swap is based on the authorizations granted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 25 March 2010 . Before the Share Swap , the Company has issued 62,002,120 shares , out of which 2,524,760 shares are held by the Company . After the Share Swap , the number of issued Konecranes Plc shares will increase to 62,283,127 shares , out of which the Company will own 2,524,760 shares directly and 517,696 shares indirectly through KCR Management Oy .

"Leverkusen , LANXESS and Dutch company Royal DSM N.V. have reached an agreement in principle involving the sale of DSM Elastomers to LANXESS for EUR 310 million on a cash and debt-free basis . DSM Elastomers produces the synthetic rubber ethylene propylene diene monomer ( EPDM ) under the brand name Keltan . The price for the DSM Elastomers business represents an EBITDA multiple of roughly 6 based on the expected EBITDA of 2010 . The acquisition will be financed by LANXESS out of existing liquidity and is expected to be EPS accretive as of 2011 . The transaction contracts will be finalized once a consultation process with the employees ' representatives of DSM in the Netherlands has been completed . The transaction is subject to approval from antitrust authorities . Closing is expected in the first months of 2011 . Sittard-Geleen-based DSM Elastomers has approximately 420 employees worldwide and is expected to achieve sales of about EUR 380 million in 2010 . DSM operates an EPDM plant in Sittard-Geleen , the Netherlands , with an annual production capacity of 160,000 metric tons . DSM 's other EPDM plant is based in Triunfo , Brazil , with an annual capacity of 40,000 metric tons . LANXESS plans to base the headquarters of the combined EPDM businesses in Sittard-Geleen . LANXESS ' Technical Rubber Products business unit ( TRP ) sells EPDM under the brand name Buna EP . LANXESS produces EPDM in Marl , Germany , and Orange , United States , with a combined annual capacity of 120,000 metric tons . The global rubber market for ethylene propylene diene monomer ( EPDM ) is expected to show single-digit percentage growth per annum in the next ten years , driven by rising demand in China and Brazil . Through the transaction , LANXESS plans to strengthen its technology base by gaining access to the ACE technology . DSM is in the process of implementing this technology on a larger scale at its site in Sittard-Geleen . In comparison to conventional technology , ACE reduces the energy and production costs for EPDM and at the same time broadens the application possibilities of the rubber . LANXESS will evaluate implementing ACE technology into its existing plants . EPDM is used above all in the automobile industry but also in the plastics modification , cable and wire , construction and oil additives industries . Its properties include very low density , good resistance to heat , oxidation , chemicals and weathering as well as good electrical insulation properties .

"Neumarkt , December 15 , 2010 , The Supervisory Board of SDAX listed Pfleiderer AG ( ISIN DE 0006764749 ) has agreed to the closure of the particleboard plant in Ebersdorf and the MDF plant in Nidda , as proposed by the Executive Board . The closures will affect around 300 employees at the locations concerned and in the administrative offices in Neumarkt and Gütersloh . While alternative continuation concepts for Ebersdorf were rejected as non-expedient , alternative usage possibilities are still being sought with possible strategic investors , irrespective of the discontinuation of MDF production in Nidda . In view of the substantial over-capacities for particleboard and MDF in Europe in combination with the continual price increases in raw materials such as wood and adhesive , and energy costs , the continued operation of both plants is no longer feasible . The closures will lead to one-off costs of about EUR 42 million , of which approx . EUR 25 million will have a cash effect . This is partly counteracted by expected revenue from the sale of plant and property in the amount of approx . EUR 25 million . The company is currently negotiating with interested parties for the plant and potential buyers of the sites , who intend to manufacture other products here .

"As the performance of the Topdeq group has continued to develop negatively even after the phase-out of the economic crisis in 2010 , TAKKT will completely write off the group 's goodwill amounting to EUR 12.9 million in the fourth quarter . This non-cash item accordingly reduces all earnings figures of the TAKKT Group below the EBITDA . The Group 's equity ratio will be at around 45 percent even after the goodwill amortisation . In the third quarter of 2010 , TAKKT has initiated a project for repositioning the Topdeq brand . This includes measures in the areas of assortment , services and advertising . Even after the adjustment , TAKKT considers the Topdeq group as an important component of the TAKKT portfolio with positive prospects for the development of turnover as well as profit . The goodwill impairment has no effect on the dividend policy or the outlook for the year 2010 The TAKKT Management Board still aims at proposing a dividend amounting to the previous year 's value to the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting . The Management Board now assumes organic turnover growth of around four percent for the financial year 2010 due to the still positive economic dynamics in Europe and North America .

According to audited , but not yet certified , figures for the 2009_2010 financial year ( 1 October to 30 September ) , ISRA has increased the group 's revenues by twelve percent to EUR 64.8 million and further expanded its market leadership . As a result of new higher performance products and a broad-based innovation and marketing offensive , ISRA is benefitting from increasing investment activities of important customers . In the fourth quarter the group 's revenues rose by 28 percent compared to previous year 's quarter . It is becoming apparent that the industries addressed by ISRA have recovered from the recession in some segments . ISRA achieved the highest increases in revenues , sometimes more than 40 percent , in the Plastics , Metal and Print business units . While business in Paper segment was still moderate , glass was able to achieve the high level of last year again . The Automotive business unit developed well . Growth in Asia was the strongest of the regional markets . Europe developed well and business in the United States grew better than expected with double-digit rates .

The gross profit raised to EUR 42.6 million ( PY EUR 38.1 million ) , and the gross margin improved to 59 percent in relation to the total output ( PY 58 percent ) . Administration costs increased by two percent to EUR 3.8 million , clearly disproportionately to business development . Their share of total output decreased to five percent ( PY six percent ) .

The EBIT and EBT margins ( in terms of total output ) were therefore improved by two percentage points each to 16 percent and 15 percent respectively . Net earnings after minority interests amounted to EUR 7.0 million ( PY EUR 6.5 million ) . This corresponds to earnings per share ( EPS ) of EUR 1.62 ( PY EUR 1.52 ) . The operational cash flow of EUR 7.7 million ( PY EUR 16.4 million ) is influenced by the strong order entry in the fourth quarter . The liquid assets increased by 30.09.2010 from EUR 0.9 million to EUR 8.0 million . In the Surface Vision segment ISRA is the global innovation and market leader . Revenue increased by 13 percent to EUR 53.3 million . The EBIT improved by 21 percent to EUR 9.6 million .

The management expects the positive development in Europe and North America to continue . Further growth in revenues is expected in the Metal , Plastics , Print and Glass segments . The management continues to see good potential in the Special Paper business . There seems to be a recovery of the market in Paper . As a result of the innovation offensive in this segment , much of which originates from the new subsidiary in Helsinki , the management is expecting the Paper business to lead to new dimensions in the long-term .

"Press information Sales and earnings in the first half of the 2010_11 fiscal year Wolford achieves sales growth and significant earnings increase , Sales up 8.1 percent to EUR 74.0 million , Gratifying performance of retail stores , Net profit for the period more than doubled , Further optimization of the asset and capital structure Vienna_Bregenz , December 17 , 2010 In the first half of the 2010_11 fiscal year ( May 1 , 2010 , October 31 , 2010 ) , the Wolford Group succeeded in further raising total sales from the previous year 's period and achieving disproportionately high increases in its earnings indicators . Whereas sales of the international fashion company climbed 8.1 percent above the prior-year level , the result from continuing operations was almost doubled . ` The positive sales trend of previous quarters has continued . Our retail business developed particularly gratifyingly , serving as the main growth driver of the Group in the first half-year . This shows that strategic orientation focusing on expanding monobrand outlets together with the persistent improvement of distribution quality has clearly been and still is the right path to take ' , comments Holger Dahmen , Chief Executive Officer of Wolford Aktiengesellschaft . ` The positive earnings development shows that we have emerged strengthened from this economically challenging period . At the beginning of the economic crisis , we reacted timely and flexibly and continue to strongly concentrate on consistently implementing cost reduction and efficiency-enhancement measures . As a result , we can report a considerable improvement in operating earnings indicators in the reporting period ' , Holger Dahmen concludes . Further upturn in sales and significant improvement of all relevant earnings indicators On balance , total sales of the Wolford Group rose 8.1 percent in the first half of the 2010_11 fiscal year , amounting to EUR 74.0 million ( H1 2009_10 EUR 68.5 million ) . This development can primarily be attributed to the gratifying performance of Wolford 's proprietary stores , which raised sales by 16.1 percent in the first half of the current fiscal year . The positive development of key earnings indicators was even more pronounced in the reporting period , posting disproportionate growth compared to the rise in sales . Accordingly , EBITDA of the Wolford Group amounted to EUR 7.1 million , an increase of 20.3 percent from the level of EUR 5.9 million in the first half of 2009_10 . The corresponding EBITDA margin improved from 8.7 to 9.6 percent . The increase in the operating profit ( EBIT ) was even more impressive , climbing by 55.8 percent to EUR 3.2 million , up from EUR 2.1 million in the first six months of the previous year . The gratifying development in the operating earnings indicators is the result of the ongoing persistent implementation of cost reduction and efficiency-enhancement measures . Against this backdrop , the Wolford Group came close to doubling the result from continuing operations , which totaled EUR 2.5 million in the reporting period ( H1 2009_10 EUR 1.3 million ) . The profit for the period rose to EUR 1.9 million compared to EUR 0.8 million in the first half of the previous year , an improvement of 152.8 percent . Earnings per share were EUR 0.39 ( H1 2009_10 EUR 0.15 ) . Reduction of net debt and higher equity ratio In the first half of the current fiscal year , Wolford continued its efforts to optimize financial resources tied up in working capital . An efficient inventory management reduced inventories by EUR 5.7 million from the level at the reporting date for the first half of the 2009_10 fiscal year . At the same time , the Wolford Group succeeded in reducing liabilities to banks , which in turn resulted in a significant reduction of net debt to EUR 23.5 million at present , down from EUR 37.7 million at the end of previous year 's reporting period . The gearing ratio fell from 48.6 to 29.1 percent . The equity ratio as at October 31 , 2010 improved to 52.5 percent ( October 31 , 2009 48.2 percent ) . On an absolute basis , shareholders ' equity rose from EUR 77.4 million at the half-year 2009_10 reporting date to the current level of EUR 81.0 million as at October 31 , 2010 . Almost all of Wolford 's core geographic markets on a growth path Most of Wolford 's core geographic markets generated double-digit growth rates in sales in the reporting period . In particular , the promising future market of Asia_Oceania once again achieved a significant expansion of sales , which rose 37.0 percent in the first half-year 2010_11 . Considerable growth was also posted in the USA ( _ 24.3 percent ) , Switzerland ( _ 18.6 percent ) and Great Britain ( _ 17.9 percent ) . The market in Spain and Belgium achieved a sales increase of about 15 percent , compared to approximately 12 percent in Italy and Scandinavia . Whereas Germany ( _ 5.4 percent ) also boosted sales and Central and Eastern Europe matched the previous year 's figures , declining sales were reported in Austria ( -0.3 percent ) , the Netherlands ( -3.4 percent ) and France ( -3.5 percent ) . Retail locations propel growth Sales in Wolford 's proprietary stores ( boutiques , shop-in-shops and factory outlets ) as well as with distribution partners both increased in the first six months of the 2010_11 fiscal year , with retail outlets generating a much higher sales increase of 16.1 percent . In part , this was due to expanded distribution of Wolford-owned locations . On a like-for-like basis , sales were up 7.7 percent . As a consequence , the retail segment increased its share of total Group sales to 47.4 percent ( H1 2009_10 44.3 percent ) . Considering the sales development of the individual distribution channels in greater detail , Wolford 's own boutiques developed particularly positively ( _ 14.2 percent ) . Due to the fact that sales with partner-operated boutiques also improved by 4.2 percent , the most important distribution channel ` boutiques ' , which accounted for 46.0 percent of sales in the reporting period , generated an overall sales growth of 11.4 percent . As at the reporting date of October 31 , 2010 , Wolford distributed its products via a network of 217 boutiques ( 105 owned by Wolford and 112 operated by partners ) . The business with department stores ( _ 12.4 percent ) also developed particularly gratifyingly in the first half of the 2010_11 fiscal year , which is mainly related to growth at Wolford 's own concession shop-in-shops . Taking account of the nine additional concession shop-in-shops opened in Spain by the end of October 2010 , this category achieved a 53.1 percent jump in sales during the reporting period . Whereas sales at factory outlets were up 10.4 percent , business with multi-brand retailers remained stable at the prior-year level . Wolford 's online business further gained in importance in the reporting period , with e-commerce sales rising 60.2 percent on a like-for-like basis compared to the previous year . Based on the good performance of Wolford 's controlled distribution channels ( own and partner-operated boutiques , factory outlets and concession shop-in-shops ) , the sales share of monobrand distribution was up to 59.1 percent ( H1 2009_10 56.7 percent ) in the reporting period . Outlook The financial results of the Wolford Group developed positively as expected in the first half of the 2010_11 fiscal year , due to the gratifying sales growth as well as the rigorous implementation of cost reduction and efficiency-enhancement measures . For this reason , Wolford will continue to strongly concentrate on both of these aspects . With respect to marketing , the market launch of new products and the already-planned measures to expand market penetration should further contribute to increasing demand . The focus of expanded sales activities will be on the Asian region ( in particular China ) , which reported gratifying growth rates in the reporting period .

Further optimisation of the portfolio , cost-cutting in operational areas and a greater focus on generating cash flow leads us to expect further improvement for the following quarters . Income from asset management In the first half of financial year 2010_11 , rental income of EUR 277.1 million was generated . This represents to a rise of 4.9 % compared to the same period in the previous year ( EUR 264.0 million ) . Whilst revenues over the same period rose by 3.3 % from EUR 352.5 million to EUR 364.3 million , income from asset management of EUR 224.2 million slightly decreased ( 2009_10 EUR 229.3 million ) . Retail income , especially following the opening of the Golden Babylon Rostokino shopping center in Moscow , was buoyant and rose year-on-year by more than EUR 18.9 million to EUR 87.9 million . Office rental income dropped as a result of real estate sales and the start of construction work in Cologne 's Gerling Quarter , which had previously been let . Income from property sales Income amounting to EUR 13.3 million was generated from property sales in the reporting period . Compared to income in the previous year of EUR 12.4 million , this represents a rise of 7.3 % . The sold properties were mainly residential properties in Austria . Income from development Both the proceeds and the income arising from the sale of inventories in the portfolio rose significantly compared to the same period in the previous year . Whilst we generated proceeds of EUR 9.3 million and income of EUR 1.9 million in the first half of 2009_10 , we achieved proceeds of EUR 36.3 million and income of EUR 6.2 million in the first six months of financial year 2010_11 . EUR 27.5 million of the sales proceeds from these inventories relate to Austria , EUR 5.8 million to Poland and EUR 3.0 million to Serbia . EBITDA , EBIT , EBT , net profit for the period and cash flow Results of operations ( EBITDA ) fell compared to the same period in the previous year from EUR 216.9 million to EUR 181.4 million . This fall is mainly due to other operating income being EUR 34.5 million lower year-on-year . This reduction is in turn due to the lack of extraordinary income that was reported in the previous year . Thanks to the positive revaluation results of EUR 86.3 million ( 2009_10 EUR 7.7 million ) , which were mainly due to foreign exchange effects , EBIT rose by 19.2 % from EUR 224.6 million to EUR 267.7 million . Due to the lack of extraordinary items , significant income was generated in the same period of the previous year from the repurchase of convertible bonds , and expenses from foreign exchange fluctuations , the financial result decreased from EUR -17.2 million to EUR -149.3 million . This pushed earnings before tax ( EBT ) down from EUR 207.4 million to EUR 118.4 million . Taxes fell from EUR -43.9 million to EUR -10.1 million . All this led to a fall in net profit for the period from EUR 163.5 million to EUR 108.3 million . Gross cash flow dropped from EUR 173.9 million to EUR 147.4 million . However , cash flow from operating activities rose from EUR 187.0 million to EUR 194.3 million , particularly due to the reduction in accounts receivable . Total operating cash flow , which includes both cash flow from operating activities and from investing activities , improved in the first half of financial year 2010_11 to EUR 222.0 million ( 2009_10 EUR 34.6 million ) , since the proceeds of sales were significantly higher than capital expenditures . NAV per share and earnings per share The diluted net asset value ( NAV ) per share rose from EUR 4.82 as of 31 July 2010 to EUR 4.95 . Based on the share price as of 31 October 2010 ( EUR 2.83 ) , IMMOFINANZ shares are therefore trading at a discount of 42.87 % to NAV .

The Executive Board of Tognum AG , specialist for propulsion and power solutions , has decided to discontinue its fuel-cell activities for stationary power generation . Having carefully examined the most recent demand forecasts and carried out a thorough risk_reward analysis , Tognum opted against further active engagement in this area . The company has come to the conclusion that the fuel-cell business is unlikely to become commercially viable in the medium term , given current market conditions and subsidy schemes . In the course of this year , management had actively looked at additional market initiatives in support of fuel-cell technology in Asia . Management also analyzed potential partnerships for serial production in Asia , which , however , proved not sufficiently promising . After negotiations with a potential Asian partner , which had appeared promising at first , ended without agreement on 28 December 2010 , the Executive Board took the decision to discontinue its fuel-cell activities . Impact on 2010 und 2011 Guidance for the full year 2010 is unaffected by this decision Tognum continues to expect revenues of around EUR2 ,550 million and an adjusted EBIT margin in the upper range of the previously given corridor of 7.5 to 9 % .

During the share buy-back program 2009 343,800 of up to 400,000 treasury shares were repurchased by ZhongDe Waste Technology AG ( ` Company ' ) . The resolution of the Management Board on the share buy-back program 2009 , signed on 06 September 2009 , is no longer valid , because the authorization to buy back shares granted by the AGM on 31 July 2009 was abrogated by a new authorization granted by the AGM on 29 June 2010 . The management board of the Company is entitled to repurchase up to 1,300,000 treasury shares according to this new authorization . This corresponds to up to 10 % of the current share capital of the Company . The Management Board resolved on 31 December 2010 to buy back 56,200 shares in order to complete the share buy-back program 2009 , based on the new authorization granted by the AGM on 29 June 2010 . The share buy-back will start not earlier than 31 December 2010 . The authorization expires on 28 June 2015 .

Further , the share offering in ZhongDe Waste Technology AG as consideration may turn out to be feasible to build up a long-term relationship between the Company and potential investors especially in Asia . In this case the shareholders shall be excluded from subscription of treasury shares . The treasury shares will be bought back over the stock exchange . The price per share paid by the Company ( excluding incidental costs of acquisition ) must be within a range of 10 per cent above or below the opening price at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange 's Xetra trading system . The total amount of payment for the repurchased shares should not exceed EUR 650,000.00 ( for 56,200 shares ) . Not more than 25 per cent of the average daily turnover of the Company 's shares will be repurchased at the respective stock exchange per day . The average daily share turnover is calculated on the basis of the average daily trading volume in the relevant trading segment during the last 20 trading days before the date of purchase .

"FINNAIR PLC STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE 7 January 2011 AT 09 00 In 2010 , boosted by Asian traffic , Finnair 's scheduled traffic grew by 2.5 % compared with the previous year . Finnair 's Asian traffic alone grew by 8 % . A total of 6.2 million passengers were carried in scheduled traffic during the year , which was just under 1 % less than the previous year . In Asian traffic , Finnair carried more than 1.2 million passengers . ` We have done well in achieving growth in Asian traffic in line with our strategy , and the price level of tickets has also developed more favourably , ' says Finnair 's Chief Financial Officer Erno Hildén . Unit revenues per passenger kilometre in Finnair 's scheduled traffic rose in the final quarter of the year by 15 % . Due to strong third quarter , unit revenues per passenger kilometre rose in the whole of last year by 9 % . The positive development of unit revenues is due mainly to an increase in business travel in traffic between Europe and Asia . On all Finnair flights , 7.1 million passengers were carried in 2010 , which was 4 % less than in 2009 . As a result of the volcanic eruption in Iceland , ash restricted flying in the spring , which , together with a cabin staff strike and a decline in leisure traffic , reduced Finnair 's overall traffic by just under 4 % . European traffic declined by 2.5 % and domestic traffic by just over 4 % last year . Capacity was successfully reduced , however , to meet the fall in demand , so the load factor improved in all traffic by just under one percentage point to 77 % and in scheduled traffic by just over than one percentage point to nearly 75 % . In Asian traffic , the load factor climbed by nearly three percentage points to nearly 82 % . The amount of cargo carried by Finnair grew by 38 % in 2010 . This impressive growth figure is due mainly to the cargo aircraft operations that began in May , but also due to a pick-up in cargo demand , particularly in Asia . The December traffic figures were adversely affected by a strike by cabin staff , which lasted more than a week . Traffic declined by more than 26 % compared with December the previous year . Cargo , however , grew in December by 33 % , because cargo was flown also during the strike . In December , punctuality also suffered as a result of the strike . Just under 58 % of flights arrived on schedule , and punctuality in scheduled traffic was just over 59 % . In December of the comparison year , punctuality figures were low , so the improvement both for traffic as a whole and scheduled traffic was more than 7 % .

This will equip the company for further growth from both its own business and from contract manufacturing . The first phase , which is to be completed by the third quarter , involves completing the new building with an extra 150 MWp of manufacturing capacity . The number of jobs at Wismar will then rise by around 300 to roughly 700 . The investment volume for the first phase amounts to around EUR 20 million . It will be financed from the company 's own cash flow as well as through subsidies and bank loans .",8.713685,9.32054,True,True
"Vantaa , Finland , 2011-01-11 08 00 CET ( GLOBE NEWSWIRE ) -- Cramo Plc Stock Exchange Release 11 January 2011 at 9.00 am Finnish time ( GMT +2 ) Cramo acquires Theisen Baumaschinen AG and expands into Germany , Austria , Switzerland and Hungary Cramo Plc has signed an agreement to acquire 100 per cent of the share capital of Theisen Baumaschinen AG ( ` Theisen ' ) , a German-based equipment rental group . The seller is Arrex Beteiligungs-GmbH , a privately-owned holding company . The purchase price will be approximately EUR 47million . EUR 40 million of the consideration will be paid in cash and the rest in Cramo Plc 's new shares pursuant to a directed share issue to be made to the seller equaling to approximately EUR 7 million . Cramo will also assume Theisen 's existing net interest-bearing debt and financial leasing liabilities , resulting in an enterprise value of approximately EUR 85 million for the transaction . Cramo will use its existing long-term credit facilities to finance the transaction . The transaction-related intangible assets and goodwill total approximately EUR 21 million . The number of Cramo Plc 's new shares to be issued as consideration will be determined based on the weighted average stock exchange price of Cramo Plc 's shares for the period of fifteen consecutive exchange trading days prior to and ending after expiration of five consecutive exchange trading days following the signing of the agreement . Cramo Plc 's Board of Directors will use the share issue authorisation granted to it by the Annual General Meeting held on 13 April 2010 for the directed share issue . Theisen Group is among the top-three providers of equipment rental services in Germany with a rental fleet consisting primarily of construction machinery , access equipment and tools . In addition to equipment rental , the company carries out a smaller equipment trading operation . Approximately 90 % of sales are generated in Germany , where Theisen has a wide national presence through 90 rental depots . International operations include nine rental depots in Austria , three in Switzerland and one in Hungary . Theisen Group has 274 employees and its customers include building and construction companies , property management companies , the service industry as well as private customers . In 2009 , Theisen generated sales of approximately EUR 85.7 million , EBITDA of approximately EUR 11.4 millionand EBIT of approximately EUR 3.0 million ( IFRS adjusted ) . Theisen 's EBITDA margin is affected by a siginificant part of the Group 's fleet being financed by operational leasing . The Group 's profitability is expected to have improved somewhat in 2010 . Theisen 's final IFRS figures will be verified after the closing . Theisen Group 's geographic coverage in Germany , Austria , Switzerland and Hungary complements very well with Cramo 's current operations in the Nordic countries and Central and Eastern Europe . Germany is Europe 's largest construction market and the 4th largest equipment rental market . The size of the German equipment rental market is estimated at approximately EUR 3.5 billion . Rental penetration in Germany is still relatively low . ` Through the acquisition of Theisen , Cramo strengthens its leading market position in the European equipment rental market . Theisen is an ideal complement to our current business operations not only from a geographic , but also from a product , service and customer perspective ' , says Vesa Koivula , President and CEO of the Cramo Group . ` Theisen 's wide depot coverage provides us good opportunities to introduce new products , services and concepts to Theisen 's existing customers , while also better opportunities to serve new customers in the European markets . We also thinkthat the timing is right for the transaction , as we are already seeing economic recovery in Theisen 's markets after the recession . ' The transaction is expected to be earnings-neutral to Cramo Group in 2011 and earnings-accretive thereafter . Cramo will book one-off transaction costs of approximately EUR 2 million in its result for the first quarter of 2011 .

"schlott gruppe Continued existence of debt financing at risk Freudenstadt , January 14 , 2011 . schlott gruppe AG has suffered a severe setback today in its restructuring process . As communicated several times , schlott gruppe AG has been in an extensive restructuring process since 2009 . Even if reducing the costs could be reached to the full intended extent in the financial year 2009_10 , the development of the market and the related pricing pressure in the market have taken a more negative development than expected and have put the earning rates under an enormous pressure . As a result , the company figures in the last months of the financial year 2009_10 have developed worse than assumed in the financial planning on which the current financing had been based . As also already published , the basis for the current restructuring and the underlying financing was the business model derived from the former restructuring schedule . As customary in such situations , the creditors have an extraordinary right to terminate the relevant loan agreements in case the company figures fall below the business planning . As a further consequence , a material writing down of goodwill is expected in the consolidated annual statements for the financial year 2009_10 . The exact amount , however , has not yet been decided upon . As a reaction to such market developments , in autumn 2010 schlott gruppe AG together with external advisors has developed a concept for strategically repositioning the company as well as a corresponding financing concept . Besides a substantial capital increase this financing concept comprises further extensive concessions with respect to debt capital . In the course of these negotiations the repayment of due bank liabilities has been deferred . Despite the intensive and promising negotiations in the last few months with both the providers of equity capital and of dept capital the company today has been informed that the negotiations with a potential equity capital provider have not been successful . On Monday next week a meeting with the financing partners on the debt capital-side will take place in Nuremberg in order to discuss the next steps and measures to be taken .

Through an asset deal , the new company will acquire the business of P.O. Korhonen , currently a subsidiary of Martela . The joint venture to be established will concentrate on manufacturing products marketed and sold by Martela and Artek . Martela will own 51 % , and Artek 49 % , of the new company . P.O. Korhonen will operate as a contract manufacturer , focusing on the manufacture of wooden furniture using form-pressing technology . The company currently employs about 40 people at its plant in Raisio . The unique expertise in wood treatment , bending and form pressing will be retained , forming the core of the new company 's operations . The joint venture will invest about EUR 500,000 in production technology straight away . With the aid of a new surface treatment line it will be possible to develop efficient and environmentally friendly surface treatment methods . In the future , the joint venture will also have a key enabling role in Artek 's new product development . Both long-established design companies will benefit from the high-quality manufacturing and technical expertise . Having locally based manufacturing in Finland will allow quick , flexible and customer-focused solutions , which is essential in international projects in particular . Networking and focusing on local production will guarantee the companies a strong competitive position globally . The company 's revenue for 2011 is estimated at EUR 4-5 million . According to Artek 's Managing Director , Mirkku Kullberg , the collaboration with Martela represents a significant step forward in the Finnish furniture sector . ` This is a key part of our strategy aimed at managing the entire value chain from manufacturing to distribution , allowing us to secure profitability and the best possible customer service .

It 's time to think differently and engage in cooperation that can help assemble an international standard of operations . For us at Artek , Martela stands for solid expertise in procurement and efficient manufacturing , ' says Mirkku Kullberg . Martela 's Managing Director , Heikki Martela , thinks positively of Artek 's values , which embrace Martela 's key goal of preserving Finland 's special furniture manufacturing expertise . ` Without such boldness to invest in Finnish production , special wood treatment expertise would have vanished in Finland . Artek is a natural partner for us in terms of strategy , values and the brand . With Finnish manufacturing , we guarantee our customers advantages that can not be imported from afar . In the future we can look at further forms of cooperation with Artek , for instance in B-to-B sales , in keeping with Martela 's approach to complete service offering , ' explains Heikki Martela .",1.115244,0.7174133,True,True

Shareholders have from Tuesday , January 18 , 2011 to midnight Central European Time , Tuesday , February 1 , 2011 , to accept the offer . The buy-back price for each share offered back to the Company will be EUR 7.45 , which represents a premium of approximately 9,5 % on the average closing price for shares of the Company in Xetra trading over the five trading days on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange preceding publication of the share buy-back offer and a premium of approximately 12.7 % on the average price of the past twelve months .

The Company , a publicly traded direct supplier to the automotive industry , raised its revenue by 10 percent to EUR31 .0 million during the six-month period from June 1 to November 30 , 2010 ( 2009 EUR28 .1 million ) . With revenue at EUR16 .6 million ( 2009 EUR15 .7 million ) , the quarter covering the period from September 1 to November 30 , 2010 underscored this growth trend .

In addition to generating consistent revenue growth , paragon earned considerably higher profits . Earnings before interest and tax ( EBIT ) improved year on year from a loss of EUR2 .0 million to a profit of EUR5 .4 million , while earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) rose from EUR0 .5 million to EUR7 .9 million .

"NEO INDUSTRIAL PLC STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE 19 JANUARY 2011 at 10.15 am AVILON DEVELOPS ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY CLEANTECH INNOVATION Neo Industrial Plc 's viscose fiber division , Avilon Ltd , is developing manufacturing technology with the aim of viscose production without carbon disulphide . The Valkeakoski production plant is testing VTT 's ( Technical Research Centre of Finland ) patented technology under license , in which carbon disulfide is replaced with urea . This method can produce viscose like fibers without using toxic and hazardous , carbon disulphide . Although the proper use of carbon disulphide is well controlled in the Valkeakoski plant , its elimination from the process would be beneficial to both the environment and the company . The new production process would enable Avilon to reduce energy consumption by about 40 percent . In addition , investment by Avilon in future production expansion projects would be reduced by about a third , because carbon disulphide requires large investments in environmental protection and occupational safety . All Avilon products can be manufactured using the carbamate process , although production of the most demanding flame retardant fibers requires further development . Carbamate technology also enables completely new types of fiber products to be developed . One of the most significant advantages of the technology is the fact that , unlike the carbon disulfide process , the intermediate product , cellulose carbamate , can be stored and transported as well as sold for instance . In the future , Avilon can also sell the technology it develops , setting a new standard in the field . In this project , decades of experience gives Avilon the added advantage of a technological head start . The company also has a functioning plant , which has all the capabilities to develop carbamate technology as well as other fiber technologies . According to current estimates , Avilon could take the carbamate process into commercial use by 2013 . Avilon 's viscose fiber production started on 3 January 2011 , with the first fiber bales produced on 14 January 2011 . According to Neo Industrial 's estimates and based on the production of Kuitu Finland Oy , Avilon 's predecessor , Avilon has the possibility to achieve an 80 million euro turnover this year with about 30,000 tonnes capacity .

In order to streamline the company 's industrial structure , HK Ruokatalo will , together with representatives of the personnel , seek solutions regarding the future roles of the production facilities in Säkylä and Mellilä .

"Nastola , Finland , 2011-01-20 12 45 CET ( GLOBE NEWSWIRE ) -- RAUTE CORPORATION STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE 20 January 2011 at 1 45 p.m. RAUTE TO HAVE OVER EUR 12 MILLION IN ORDERS FROM RUSSIA Raute Corporation has received orders worth over EUR 12 million from OOO ` Ilim Bratsk DOK ' in Russia . The orders include , among others , two state-of-the-artpeeling lines and two drying lines to be delivered to Bratsk , Siberia , by the end of 2011 . Raute 's leading softwood plywood technology , solid references for successful deliveries to Russia and strong service capacity through a local after-salescompany all contributed to winning the order . One of Raute 's first-ever mill-scale deliveries was made in 1970 to Bratsk . OOO ` Ilim Bratsk DOK 's plywood mill in Bratsk is the largest softwood plywood mill in Russia , and the only one to focus on the manufacture of softwood plywood . The raw material used is mainly Siberian pine and larch . The plywood mill 's annual production capacity totals approximately 200,000 cubic meters . The mill has long traditions and holds an established position in the markets . The current investment is the first in a large-scale modernization plan . The new equipment will entirely replace the mill 's current veneer production . The RauteSmart peeling lines included in the transaction feature curtain lasers for the centering systemsto increase recovery and productivity , automatic scanning for veneer clipping as well as random stacking . RauteSmart drying lines include a non-stop feeding system , three-zone dryer with automatic adjustment of the drying conditions in each zone and automatic veneer grading based on color camera technology . Russia is globally the leading manufacturer of birch veneer , although use of the vast softwood resources as a plywood raw material has been modest so far . The current investment will increase the Bratsk mill 's competitiveness and profitability to a level which Raute believes will boost the development of the Russian softwood plywood segment in general . The strength and stiffness of softwood plywood are high , but it is softer and has more knots than birch plywood . On the other hand , softwood plywood is fairly light and easy to machine and nail . Typical end-uses include roof structures , floorings , walls and ceilings , non-visible structures in vehicles , packaging and boxes , construction site structures , fencing and shelters , and formwork with a limited number of concrete pourings . Softwood plywood with three thick veneer plies is also used as a wind barrier in construction thanks to its breathability and stiffness . The machinery and equipment will be manufactured at Raute 's main production unit in Nastola , Finland , and by its partner network , except for the machine vision system , which will be manufactured at the Kajaani unit in Finland . Raute will publish its net sales and financial performance information for 2010 and outlook for 2011 in the financial statements on February 15 , 2011 .

Turnover of the expired fiscal year has stabilized on previous year 's level . Gross profit increased to Euro 19.5 million . The first three quarters were marginally below previous year 's results , the 4th quarter reversed the trend with a turnover of Euro 8.51 million , which continued in fiscal year 2010_2011 with an average growth of 15 % .

This is equivalent to a growth of 29.7 percent . The fourth quarter was particularly strong with provisional revenue of EUR 167.8 million , as compared with EUR 118.1 million in the fourth quarter 2009 ( +42.1 percent ) . With the focus on high-quality services , particularly in the cloud computing environment , the Group 's provisional consolidated EBITDA was at EUR 19.0 million ( up by +82.7 percent ) not only well above the previous year 's figure of EUR 10.4 million , but also well in excess of analysts ' estimates .

"Brilon , January 25 , 2011 , Based on provisional , unaudited figures CENTROTEC Sustainable AG , Brilon , fully achieved the forecast for the 2010 financial year that was upgraded several times in the course of that year . Revenue will reach EUR 480 million and therefore lie within the bandwidth of EUR 480 to 500 million as forecast at the start of the year . The operating result ( EBIT ) will be up by around one-quarter and consequently fully reach the forecast that was revised upwards in-year to EUR 36 to 37 million ( original forecast EUR 30 to 32 million , previous year EUR 29 million ) . Earnings per share ( EPS ) , too , are fully within the forecast range of EUR 1.50 to 1.60 that was upgraded twice during the year ( from originally EUR 1.10 to 1.20 ) . This growth in revenue and earnings stems from the positive development of all areas of the group , but particularly from increased shares of the German heating market and the substantial recovery of export business . Furthermore , the highly competitive product range of energy-saving solutions for buildings , further advances in consolidating the strong market position and the group-wide efficiency enhancement programs have been major factors in producing an overproportional rise in the operating result . Forecast for 2011 For 2011 , CENTROTEC believes that the market prospects for energy-efficient heating , climate control and ventilation technology and for integrated solutions for the use of renewables in buildings remain very bright , coupled with a continuing recovery in the economy as a whole . The newly launched products and the innovations in the pipeline for 2011 as well as the group companies ' outstanding sales and market position are expected to push revenue up to EUR 520 to 535 million ( + 8 % compared with previous year 's lower threshold ) . The major factors at work here are the continuing high energy prices that will rise further in the medium term , increasing regulation in the sphere of climate protection and a lingering need to modernize heating systems particularly in Germany . 2011 earnings are likely to be reduced by further rises in raw material prices , which the ongoing optimisation programs in all areas of the company seek to address . On this basis , CENTROTEC is planning a further substantial rise in EBIT for 2011 to EUR 40 to 42 million ( + 11 % compared with previous year 's lower threshold ) . Working on the basis that the investment result will remain healthy , earnings per share ( EPS ) will likewise be up on the previous year at EUR 1.70 to 1.80 ( + 13 % compared with previous year 's lower threshold ) . A detailed forecast , with a breakdown by segment , will be published together with the audited annual accounts at the Annual Press Conference on March 29 , 2011 . CENTROTEC Sustainable AG CENTROTEC Sustainable AG and its subsidiaries enjoy a presence in over 50 different countries . The principal group companies are Wolf Heiztechnik , Brink Climate Systems and Ned Air in the Climate Systems segment , which have specialised in heating , climate control and ventilation technology e.g. in the form of solar thermal systems , heat pumps , CHP units , climate control and ventilation systems with heat recovery for residential and commercial buildings , as well as Ubbink and Centrotherm , which have focused on plastic gas flue and air ducting systems and solar system components in the Gas Flue Systems segment .

"Grasbrunn_Munich , January 27 , 2011 , In fiscal 2010 , Wirecard AG once again succeeded in recording substantial increases both in sales revenues and earnings . Preliminary consolidated sales revenues were up by 19 percent , from 228.5 million euros in the previous year to 271.7 million euros . Earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) rose by 21 percent , from 60.7 million euros to 73.4 million euros .

Compared with the previous year period , EBIT was up by 20 percent , from 15.8 million euros to 19.0 million euros . In view of the stable macroeconomic situation overall , the Wirecard Group 's positive performance is assumed to continue during the current financial year . The dynamic development of the European eCommerce market , which simultaneously constitutes the core market for Wirecard business-to-business and issuing solutions , represents a solid basis for further growth . The cooperation agreements entered into last year for the prepaid card business are likely to generate initial substantial profitability contributions in the second half of 2011 . At the same time , additional contributions to earnings are expected to be generated from existing and future cooperative ventures in the Asian region . In fiscal 2011 , Wirecard will report non-recurring special expenditures in two fields of activity . For one thing , the relocation of the corporate headquarters necessary for capacity reasons from Grasbrunn to Dornach near Munich will involve non-recurring costs of approximately 2 million euros within the first half of the year . For another , non-recurring IT costs of approximately 3 million euros will arise , spread across the year , which will facilitate even faster expansion in Asia . Taking account of the previously explained special expenditure , for fiscal 2011 the Management Board of Wirecard AG expects earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) in a bandwidth from 81 to 89 million euros . All results are preliminary . The annual report for 2010 will be published on April 14 , 2011 .",-3.547857,-4.712218,False,False

"The HOCHDORF Group processed 325.9 million kg of milk in Switzerland in the past business year , the second largest amount in its history . HOCHDORF surpassed the previous year 's amount of 320.4 million kg by 1.7 % . The consolidated gross turn over amounts to CHF 351.7 million despite lower milk prices , and therefore lower product prices ( previous year CHF 347.6 million , +1.2 % ) . The Group has succeeded in turning the situation around , which means that an unchanged dividend is the very least shareholders can expect . The HOCHDORF Group produced 325.9 million kg of processed milk in the past year , the second highest milk processing result in the company 's 115-year history . HOCHDORF only produced more milk in Switzerland in 2008 ( 360 million kg ) in what was a particularly strong year for milk production . With 13 million kg of processed whey and the amount of milk produced by the Lithuanian plant ( 71.6 million kg ) , the HOCHDORF-based Group achieved record figures for processed liquid quantities at 410.5 million kg . Significant growth in strategically important areas In the past business year , the HOCHDORF Group achieved a consolidated gross turnover of CHF 351.7 million ( not audited , previous year CHF 347.6 million ) . This represents a small increase in gross turnover of +1.2 % . The Lithuania plant is already fully integrated in the figures because HOCHDORF will take it over entirely in the medium term . The higher turnover was achieved despite lower average milk prices and therefore lower product prices . The previous year 's turnover also includes the turnover shares from the divested business areas amounting to CHF 13.5 million . The Group 's sales volume ( non-consolidated ) was 94,657 tonnes , even surpassing the record value from the previous year ( 82,589 , +14.6 % ) . This volume growth was achieved with constant warehouse quantities . The comparative value from 2009 was also achieved due to huge warehouse sales . The HOCHDORF Group also attained substantial growth in strategically important business areas . It sold 1,828 tonnes ( +37 % ) more infant formula and 1,100 tonnes ( +8.9 % ) more full milk powder for the Swiss chocolate industry . An intensive business year 2010 was a very challenging business year , both economically and politically . The strong Swiss franc hindered the export of quality Swiss foodstuffs such as infant formula , chocolate or biscuits . The ` Schoggi ' law contributions made available by the Swiss government to offset the handicap posed by domestic raw material prices proved far from adequate for the purpose . The HOCHDORF Group estimates its milk quantity exported in the form of infant formula , chocolate or biscuits at approximately 110 million kg . This is a considerable quantity of milk that would be lost to milk producers if the food stuffs-processing industry were to make use of the active inward processing arrangements . Fortunately an agreement was reached within the industry to offset the missing contributions from the ` Schoggi ' law . The HOCHDORF Group achieved its own internal capacity target for the new , ultra-modern spray tower line 8 in Sulgen . This involved a huge effort in the areas of production and marketing . The plant has already been running as a three-shift operation since December 2010 . The plant volume will virtually double in 2011 , which is what is required to achieve the target growth in the area of powdered infant milk formula . Growth abroad as well At the beginning of 2010 the HOCHDORF Group assumed an interest in the MGL Baltija UAB milk plant in Medeikiai , Lithuania . This plant provides the HOCHDORF Group with a foothold in the EU and with direct access to the east European market . The Group increased its share from 30 % to 45 % as of January 1 , 2011 and will take over the milk plant completely in the medium term . Projection for 2011 The optimisation and restructuring measures initiated by the HOCHDORF Group in 2009 and consistently pursued in 2010 have proved successful , and the business has been turned around . The Group is therefore expecting positive financial results for 2010 . ` With the investments we have undertaken , along with process improvements and divestments , we can look forward to the future proactively and with confidence , ' says Damian Henzi , CEO of the HOCHDORF Group . Henzi adds ` The HOCHDORF Group must and will retain its focus on achieving EU cost compatibility and internationalisation . ' The rising milk powder prices on the world market also give grounds for optimism in 2011 . And some product prices were also adjusted upwards .

"Funkwerk prospects and Algeria business Kölleda , February 2 , 2011 . In 2010 , Funkwerk AG ( ISIN DE0005753149 ) continued its restructuring and focusing efforts to achieve savings of over EUR 15m , contributed by all its business segments . Measures included the optimisation of its workflow management and a more productive use of resources . Based on the preliminary figures now available for 2010 , sales approximated last year 's level with company earnings before impairments and restructuring near break-even , improving the operating result on the previous year by around EUR13m . In light of the increasing political instability in North Africa , however , a revaluation of Funkwerk 's business in Algeria was deemed sensible for the 2010 financial statements . Funkwerk has been involved in a contract with an Algerian industrial corporation since 2006 , setting up major safety systems for key oil and gas plants including pertinent residential bases in Algeria . Sparked by radical domestic upheaval , which also led to a change in leadership at the state-owned Algerian corporation , business in the country , and particularly the ` Base 24 ' project , which was still at the time implemented , needed to be discontinued in the first half of 2010 . The risks involved in this business are detailed in the quarterly report as at 30 September . Over the past few months , efforts were made at every level to ensure a continuation and completion of the project . On grounds of the aggravating political situation in Algeria , it remains to be seen if and when these efforts will lead to success . As a result , the Executive Board of Funkwerk feels it wise to account for appropriate impairments in the 2010 financial statements . Along with other reduced items , impairments of tied-up inventories and assets made for reasons of due diligence will total up to EUR 13m and be included in the 2010 financial statements with significant impact on revenues at Funkwerk AG . If the project is resumed in 2011 or the following years , the appropriate impairments would be reversed to result in operating revenue . The preliminary figures for fiscal 2010 are due to be disclosed in early March . The full annual financial statements of Funkwerk AG will be published on 31 March 2011 .

"NEWS RELEASE International Minerals Increases Gold Resource Estimate at Goldfield Project , Nevada . Additional Drill Results include 39.6 m at 2.4 g_t Gold . Scottsdale , Arizona , February 1st , 2011 , International Minerals Corporation ( Toronto and Swiss stock exchanges ` IMZ ' ) reports an updated , increased mineral resource estimate for the Goldfield Main deposit at the 100%-owned Goldfield gold project in central Nevada . It is IMZ 's first resource estimate update at the Goldfield project since IMZ 's acquisition of the project by acquiring Metallic Ventures Gold Inc ( ` MVG ' ) in February 2010 . The Goldfield Main deposit is only one of three principal mineralized areas that have been evaluated on the Goldfield property over the past two decades . The other deposits are Gemfield and McMahon Ridge . Goldfield Main was the site of significant historical underground mining operations that reportedly produced roughly four million ounces of gold in the early 1900s . Below is the updated resource estimate for Goldfield Main using a 0.4 grams_tonne ( g_t ) cut-off grade . * Indicated Resources 421,000 ounces ( ` ozs ' ) of gold contained within 8.5 million tonnes ( ` mt ' ) at an average grade of 1.5 g_t gold . This represents a 74 % increase in estimated gold resource ounces compared to the previous Goldfield Main indicated resource estimate and a 17 % increase in total measured and indicated resources for the overall Goldfield project . * Inferred Resources 360,000 ozs of gold contained within 6.6 mt at an average grade of 1.7 g_t gold . This represents a 348 % increase in estimated gold resource ounces compared to the previous Goldfield Main inferred resource estimate and a 265 % increase in total inferred resources for the overall Goldfield project . ( Note the high percentage change in the inferred resources is due to the modest amount of the previous resource estimate that was classified in the inferred category ) . IMZ is confident that its ongoing drilling program , in areas to the east not previously drilled , will further increase the mineral resources at Goldfield Main . Table 1 Goldfield project , Goldfield Main , Mineral Resource Estimate , February 1st , 2011 Resource Estimate Category Cut-Off ( g_t gold ) Tonnes Gold Grade ( g_t ) Gold Ounces Indicated 0.6 7,053,000 1.8 397,000 0.5 7,829,000 1.6 410,000 0.4 8,549,000 1.5 421,000 0.3 9,163,000 1.5 427,000 Inferred 0.6 5,446,000 2.0 343,000 0.5 5,979,000 1.8 352,000 0.4 6,591,000 1.7 360,000 0.3 7,073,000 1.6 367,000 1 . Gold price used for the estimate is US$ 1,200 _ oz . 2 . The estimated resources are reported at a 0.4 g_t gold cut-off grade , which corresponds to an assumed $ 10 per tonne marginal cash operating cost . This case is shown in bold text in the Table above . 3 . The estimated mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability . 4 . Numbers have been rounded in all categories to reflect the precision of the estimates . 5 . The mineral resources were estimated with Micromine software using ordinary kriging to estimate metal grades . Outlier high-grade assay were top-cut , using values that depended on lithology and location . Inside the main mineralized structure , assays in intervals with lithologies that often have high gold grades were capped at 75 g_t , and assays in intervals with lithologies that rarely have high gold grades were capped at 7.5 g_t . Outside the main mineralized structure , the corresponding capping values were 9 g_t ( for high-grade lithologies ) and 5 g_t ( for low-grade lithologies ) . The Goldfield Main mineral resource estimate has been classified in accordance with CIM guidelines by independent consultant R. Mohan Srivastava ( P. Geo ) , a Qualified Person under NI 43-101 . The estimate has an effective date of February 1st , 2011 . The mineral resource estimate is based on the results of 1,116 drill holes totaling approximately 110,000 m , ( up to and including the drill holes shown in Appendix 1 ) , which have defined an area of mineralization of over 450m by 1,200 m , with an approximate 30 degree dip to the east . The main mineralized zone , which is still open down dip to the east , has been intersected by more than 800 drill holes , and contains more than 12,000 assays from approximately 18,000 m of drilling . The previous resource estimate , published in September of 2002 by MVG , was calculated for MVG by Qualified Person ( ` QP ' ) S. Ristorcelli of Mine Development Associates of Reno , Nevada . It was reported at a cut-off of 0.27 g_t gold and comprised indicated resources of 241,800 ozs gold contained within 6.0 mt at an average grade of 1.2 g_t gold and inferred resources of 80,300 ozs gold contained within 1.9 mt at an average grade of 1.3 g_t gold . Resource Estimation Methodology The resource estimation was constrained using a wireframe model to outline an east-dipping alteration ( ` EDA ' ) mineralized zone . The wireframe was constructed from cross-sectional interpretation of the EDA at Goldfield Main by IMZ geologists . A search ellipse with radii of 42.7 m and 30.5 m ( in the plane of the EDA ) and 6.1 m perpendicular to the EDA sub-divided into octants , was then used to interpolate grades into the 6.1 m by 6.1 m by 3.0 m blocks using the Ordinary Kriging capability of Micromine software . Length-weighting was used to adjust for unequal sample length intervals . Tonnage factors were assigned using block-by-block estimates of the proportion of in-situ rock ( 2.14 tonnes per cubic meter ( ` t_m3 ' ) ) , back-filled stopes ( 1.53 t_m3 ) and voids from historical mining . Within the EDA , mineral resources were classified as Indicated for all blocks that met the following criteria 1 ) at least one sample within half the range of the variogram , 2 ) at least four samples from two different drill holes in three octants . Blocks that did not meet these criteria were classified as Inferred . Additional Drill Hole Results at Goldfield Main IMZ also reports additional results from its ongoing reverse circulation ( ` RC ' ) drilling program at the Goldfield Main deposit . Highlights from this drilling program ( representing estimated true widths in meters and uncut gold grades in g_t ) , include the following intercepts * 4.3 m at 3.4 g_t in 2010-008 * 2.7 m at 4.4 g_t in 2010-008 * 6.1 m at 2.2 g_t in 2010-009 * 32.0 m at 1.3 g_t in 2010-089 * 6.1 m at 8.4 g_t in 2010-108 * 18.3 m at 4.2 g_t in 2010-111 * 39.6 m at 2.4 g_t in 2010-112 Note Some of the above highlighted drill intersections include zones of low-to-average grade material from backfill material used in historical mine workings , but are predominantly in-situ mineralization . Assay results for all 35 RC drill holes totaling 9,025 m are summarized in Appendix 1 and shown on the plan map in Appendix 2 ( Click here for news release with full appendices ) . IMZ has now reported drill results for a total of 121 RC drill holes totaling 26,600 m.",0.413796,0.2489217,True,True

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2011 or the first quarter of 2012 . It is not considered to be necessary that RBI raise new capital in the near term . The structure of the transaction foresees that at first , RBI will acquire a 70 per cent stake in Polbank for EUR 490 million cash consideration . Concurrently in a second step Eurobank EFG and RBI will transfer their respective shareholdings in Polbank ( Eurobank EFG 30 per cent and RBI 70 per cent ) to Raiffeisen Bank Polska S.A. ( RBPL ) in exchange for new shares in RBPL . As a consequence of this transaction structure Eurobank EFG will become a 13 per cent shareholder in RBPL next to RBI . The operational merger of RBPL and Polbank will conclude the transaction . Pricing of the transaction is based on a guaranteed minimum equity of EUR 400 million for Polbank and EUR 750 million for RBPL . Also as a part of the transaction arrangement , the parties have entered into a shareholder agreement which includes the granting of a put option to Eurobank EFG to dispose of its stake in the combined entity of RBPL , including Polbank , to RBI at any time at a valuation based on business performance , but no less than EUR 175 million ( plus interest ) and RBI a respective call-option exercisable from 31 March 2016 . With its strong retail focus , Polbank is an ideal complement to RBPL , which is very well positioned in the corporate segment . The acquisition will considerably strengthen RBI 's position in the largest economy with attractive growth potential in its Central Europe business segment . The combined unit RBPL_Polbank will ( based on current financial data ) become the sixth largest commercial bank in Poland in terms of assets and rank number four in the customer loan market . Polbank was set up as a greenfield operation in 2006 and focuses on business with retail customers and SMEs . The company has a nationwide network of around 350 business outlets and 2,900 employees serving around 800,000 customers . The balance sheet total as of September 30 , 2010 , was EUR 5.5 billion . RBI first entered the Polish market in 1991 , through the establishment of RBPL . Total assets related to the Group 's activities in Poland came to EUR 6.5 billion as of the end of the third quarter , 2010 . RBI employs around 3,000 people in 123 business outlets in Poland , serving over 240,000 customers .",-1.017582,-0.9592392,False,False

"Frankfurt_Main , 3 February 2011 . The Amadeus FiRe group completed fiscal year 2010 with very good results . In 2010 consolidated sales came to EUR 117.5 m , an increase of 6.1 per cent on prior year 's revenue ( EUR 110.7 m ) . The increase was primarily caused by higher temporary staffing sales . Also the service lines permanent placement _ recruitment and training and education achieved sales increases whereas interim - _ project management sales were below prior year 's level . The gross profit margin improved from 39.2 per cent in 2009 to 41.2 per cent in 2010 . This was due to a change in the service mix and a higher utilization rate in temporary staffing . The selling and administrative expenses rose by 8.7 per cent or EUR 2.4 m compared to prior year mainly due to higher payroll expenses . In the preceding fiscal year the operative group result before goodwill amortisation ( EBITA ) amounted to EUR 18.8 m ( prior year EUR 16.1 m ) , an increase of 17.4 per cent . The EBITA margin was 16.0 per cent after 14.5 per cent in the prior year . Considering the already good result in 2009 the achieved result in 2010 was well above the expectations . No goodwill was impaired in the reporting period ( in prior year EUR 0.3 m ) . Earnings before interest and tax ( EBIT ) came to EUR 18.8 m , a growth of 19.8 per cent compared to prior year . Due to the current economic projections the management expects a moderate increase of demand for Amadeus FiRe services and accordingly increasing sales for fiscal year 2011 .

"Powerflute Oyj 4 February 2011 POWERFLUTE OYJ ( ` Powerflute ' or the ` Group ' ) Pre-close Trading Update Powerflute , the international packaging and paper group with positions in Nordic semi-chemical fluting and coated woodfree papers , today provided the following update on trading . The Packaging Papers business benefited from favourable market conditions throughout the final quarter of 2010 and performed well . Demand was strong and this , together with a continuation of the upward pricing trend experienced earlier in the year , resulted in improved operating margins and good cash generation . In contrast , the Graphic Papers business faced very challenging market conditions . As predicted at the time of the rights issue and placing , softening demand resulted in lower order intake for producers of coated woodfree paper and this , together with the continuing high price of pulp , adversely affected operating margins during the final quarter . As a result , we expect the Group 's trading performance for the year ended 31 December 2010 to be comparable with the underlying trading performance achieved in the prior year . The Group has enjoyed a positive start to the new financial year . A number of projects have been initiated using the proceeds of the rights issue and placing and some are already yielding operational and financial benefits . The Group received cash consideration of EUR2 .5 m in connection with the sale of part of its interest in Harvestia to Vapo Oy , one of Finland 's leading forestry companies . Trading conditions for Packaging Papers continue to be favourable and we expect 2011 to be a good year for this business . The management team of Graphic Papers has been strengthened and although conditions remain challenging , there has been some improvement in outlook since the year end . The Board continues to view the future with confidence and believes that the Group is well positioned to benefit from current market conditions . Commenting on the statement , Dermot Smurfit , Chairman of Powerflute , said . ` While our Packaging Papers business performed strongly during the final quarter , as expected operating margins in Graphic Papers were impacted by deteriorating market conditions . We expect that the Group 's overall result for the year ended 31 December 2010 will be comparable with that of the prior year . Powerflute has made a positive start to the new financial year with good progress on projects funded from the proceeds of the rights issue and placing , continuing favourable conditions in Packaging Papers and some evidence of improvement in the outlook for Graphic Papers .

Our own competitiveness has weakened as costs have grown and we have had to consider a complete restructuring , ' says Finnair 's Senior Vice President , Technical Services Kimmo Soini . ` Finnair has implemented a comprehensive fleet renewal and the company 's present fleet is modern . A significant proportion of Finnair 's aircraft and component maintenance and repair activities would in future consist of services offered to companies outside the Finnair Group . In market-priced services , our cost-competitiveness in the field of aircraft heavy maintenance is inadequate . ' Finnair Technical Services ' operations cover daily and short-term maintenance , i.e. line maintenance , long-term heavy maintenance , and engine and component support . ` We plan to discontinue mainly external , unprofitable aircraft base maintenance work . Our objective is to focus on quality , cost-effective technical support of Finnair 's own fleet . Safeguarding and improving competitiveness is also essential in other areas of Finnair Technical Services , ' explains Soini . Statutory negotiations under the Act on Cooperation Within Undertakings , covering all of the companies ' 1,600 employees , will be initiated . The personnel reduction requirement arising from the planned changes amounts to 450 jobs . ` All of Finnair 's technical services operations will be adjusted to the new situation . The clear reduction in the amount of work will also substantially reduce the need for labor . We will make every effort to use the most flexible possible means in reducing personnel , but most probably we can not avoid significant redundancies .

"Powerflute Oyj 4 February 2011 POWERFLUTE OYJ ( ` Powerflute ' or the ` Group ' ) Pre-close Trading Update Powerflute , the international packaging and paper group with positions in Nordic semi-chemical fluting and coated woodfree papers , today provided the following update on trading . The Packaging Papers business benefited from favourable market conditions throughout the final quarter of 2010 and performed well . Demand was strong and this , together with a continuation of the upward pricing trend experienced earlier in the year , resulted in improved operating margins and good cash generation . In contrast , the Graphic Papers business faced very challenging market conditions . As predicted at the time of the rights issue and placing , softening demand resulted in lower order intake for producers of coated woodfree paper and this , together with the continuing high price of pulp , adversely affected operating margins during the final quarter . As a result , we expect the Group 's trading performance for the year ended 31 December 2010 to be comparable with the underlying trading performance achieved in the prior year . The Group has enjoyed a positive start to the new financial year . A number of projects have been initiated using the proceeds of the rights issue and placing and some are already yielding operational and financial benefits . The Group received cash consideration of EUR2 .5 m in connection with the sale of part of its interest in Harvestia to Vapo Oy , one of Finland 's leading forestry companies . Trading conditions for Packaging Papers continue to be favourable and we expect 2011 to be a good year for this business . The management team of Graphic Papers has been strengthened and although conditions remain challenging , there has been some improvement in outlook since the year end . The Board continues to view the future with confidence and believes that the Group is well positioned to benefit from current market conditions . Commenting on the statement , Dermot Smurfit , Chairman of Powerflute , said . ` While our Packaging Papers business performed strongly during the final quarter , as expected operating margins in Graphic Papers were impacted by deteriorating market conditions . We expect that the Group 's overall result for the year ended 31 December 2010 will be comparable with that of the prior year . Powerflute has made a positive start to the new financial year with good progress on projects funded from the proceeds of the rights issue and placing , continuing favourable conditions in Packaging Papers and some evidence of improvement in the outlook for Graphic Papers .

Deutsche Börse AG and NYSE Euronext believe that a combination could deliver value to clients , shareholders and other stakeholders in many ways , including . * Trading clients would benefit from significant savings available through common IT infrastructure , simplified clearing processes , capital efficiencies and the formation of a more liquid , pan-European , pan-Euro regulated market . * Deutsche Börse AG and NYSE Euronext shareholders would benefit from a more attractive revenue mix , accelerated earnings growth and from substantial cost savings . * The global capital markets would benefit from the creation of the most efficient , transparent and well-regulated markets for issuers and clients around the world .

Scottsdale , Arizona , February 14 , 2011 , International Minerals Corporation ( Toronto and Swiss stock exchanges ` IMZ ' , the ` Company ' ) reports record financial results for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31 , 2010 ( the ` current quarter ' ) , highlighted by $ 19.1 million of consolidated net income after income taxes , including net equity earnings of $ 16.3 million from the 40%-owned Pallancata Mine in Peru . All amounts in this news release are reported in US dollars . Highlights for the Three-Month Period Ended December 31 , 2010 During the current quarter , the Company achieved the following significant results . * Cash and equivalents increased by approximately $ 26.3 million to $ 51.7 million and working capital increased by approximately $ 44.9 million to end the current quarter at approximately $ 70.7 million . * A cash dividend distribution of $ 20.0 million was received from the Company 's 40%-owned Pallancata Mine , of which $ 10 million was re-invested in sustaining and new capital expenditures ( property , plant and equipment ) . This increased the total cash dividend distributions received by the Company in the 2010 calendar year to $ 36.0 million . Total cash dividend distributions received by the Company since commencement of production at Pallancata in September 2007 is $ 43.6 million . * Net income for the current quarter was approximately $ 18.0 million before provision for income taxes and $ 19.1 million after taxes . Net Income per share of $ 0.16 for the current quarter compares to $ 0.06 per share for the comparable quarter in 2009 . * The increase in income between the comparative periods resulted primarily from an increase in the net equity income recognized from the Pallancata Mine of $ 8.7 million , an increase in net royalty income of $ 1.0 and the recognition of a $ 5.6 million gain in the current quarter from the disposition of a partial interest in the Inmaculada project . These increases were partially offset by write-offs totaling $ 2.3 million for two resource properties in Peru . * Gross equity income totaling approximately $ 16.4 million and net equity income of approximately $ 16.3 million was generated during the current quarter from the 40%-owned Pallancata Mine compared to $ 8.1 million and $ 7.6 million for the quarter ended December 31 , 2009 , due primarily to increased metal production and higher metal prices during the current quarter . * The Pallancata Mine ( 100 % project basis ) produced approximately 2.76 million ounces of silver and 10,045 ounces of gold in the current quarter , compared to 2.5 million ounces of silver and 8,264 ounces of gold in the prior quarter , which ended September 30 , 2010 . The Company 's 40 % share of production in this current quarter was approximately 1.1 million ounces of silver and 4,018 ounces of gold . The increase in gold and silver production for the current quarter compared to the previous quarter was due to a 3 % increase in mill throughput coupled with increases in the grades of silver and gold processed . * Direct site costs for the current quarter at the Pallancata Mine were approximately $ 1.05 per ounce silver ( after gold by-product credits ) and total cash costs ( as defined by the Gold Institute ) were $ 4.89 per ounce silver ( after gold by-product credits ) . For the three-month period ended December 31 , 2009 , direct site costs and total cash costs were $ 1.72 and $ 4.69 per ounce silver , respectively . * Direct site costs per ounce have decreased from the comparable period in the prior year due primarily to increased silver and gold production and a higher gold-by-product credit resulting from an increase in the price of gold . Other Financial Information for the Three-month Period Ended December 31 , 2010 . * Net royalty income in the current quarter was $ 1.1 million compared to $ nil in the comparable quarter 2009 as the Ruby Hill Mine royalty was not acquired until February 2010 . * Other expenses totaled $ 2.0 million for the current quarter compared to $ 1.7 million for the quarter ended December 31 , 2009 . The increase is largely due to an increase in stock based compensation and an increase in salary expenses , the latter primarily related to the corporate acquisitions completed in 2010 . * The Company realized a recovery for future income taxes in the amount of $ 1.1 million which related to an increase in its investment in the Pallancata Mine joint venture and a reduction in its interest in the Inmaculada property . * Other notable achievements in the current quarter included completion of a private placement with Hochschild Mining plc ( ` Hochschild ' ) of $ 20.0 million from the issuance of 3,655,746 common shares and the signing of Memorandums of Understanding with China CAMC Engineering Co. . Ltd ( ` CAMCE ' ) related to the financing and construction of a mine at the Rio Blanco property in Ecuador and the future development and financing of the Gaby property , also located in Ecuador . The Company reports its interests in the Pallancata Mine and the Inmaculada property on an equity accounting basis , effective for this current quarter . Financial Results for the Six-Month Period Ended December 31 , 2010 . * Consolidated net income before provision for income taxes for the six-month period ended December 31 , 2010 was $ 25.2 million and $ 23.5 million after taxes or net income per share of $ 0.20 . This compares to net income of $ 6.6 million or $ 0.07 per share for the comparable period in 2009 . * The increase in income between the comparative periods resulted primarily from an increase in the net equity income recognized from the Pallancata Mine of $ 12.6 million , an increase in net royalty income of $ 1.8 and the recognition of a $ 5.6 million gain in this current period from the disposition of a partial interest in the Inmaculada project , offset by the write down of mineral property interests of $ 2.3 million . * The Company realized gross equity income from the Pallancata Mine for the current six-month period of $ 25.7 million compared to $ 13.3 million for the comparable period in 2009 . This increase was a function of increased metal production and higher metal prices . * Net royalty income for the current six-month was $ 1.8 million compared to $ nil in the comparable period in 2009 , as the Ruby Hill Mine royalty was not acquired until February 2010 . * Other expenses totaled $ 4.0 million for the current six-month period compared to $ 4.0 million for the comparable period in 2009 .

The reported head grades for silver and gold are based on the overall metallurgical balance for the process plant . 2 . The difference between ` produced ' metal ounces and ` sold ' metal ounces is in-process concentrate . 3 . Silver and gold ounces sold are now reported as gross ounces . IMZ has also restated the previously reported sales , which had been reported as net payable ounces . 4 . Direct site costs per ounce silver and total cash costs per ounce silver reflect a ` mined ore inventory adjustment ' . IMZ believes that this calculation more accurately matches costs with ounces of production ( Also see notes 4 and 5 below ) . 5 . Direct site costs per ounce silver comprise direct mining costs , mined ore inventory adjustment , toll processing costs and . mine general and administrative costs . The cost per ounce is net of by-product credit , with by-product gold revenue offsetting operating costs . 6 . Total cash costs , using the Gold Institute definition , comprise mine operating costs , mined ore inventory adjustment , toll processing costs , mine general and administrative costs , Hochschild management fee , concentrate transportation and smelting costs , local and regional taxes and government royalty ( currently approximately 3 % of gross revenue for Pallancata ) .

"The German federal government submitted the revised restructuring plan approved by the WestLB Supervisory Board to the European Commission on February 15 , 2011 within the agreed timeframe . The submitted plan was based on discussions with the European Commission in which the Managing Board of WestLB , in close consultation with the steering committee , outlined the structure of the new core bank to the Brussels authority . The Bank considers that the revised restructuring plan will meet with the approval of the European Commission . Under the restructuring plan , WestLB will further reduce its total assets and risk-weighted assets by 2015 . This means that , compared with the figures stipulated in the original state aid decision , WestLB will reduce its total assets and its risk-weighted assets further by approximately one third . In order to improve the framework regarding future partnership options in a potential company transaction , the Bank is proposing the separation of four legally dependent but organisationally autonomous operating units ( ` Teilbetriebe ' ) under the umbrella of WestLB . These are Verbund and Corporates , Specialised Finance , Transaction Bank and Group and Service Functions . Individual units can be incorporated into mergers or sold at a later stage in the context of partner options . The further downsizing of the Bank proposed in the revised restructuring plan involves financial burdens that must be borne by the owners , the State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the German federal government , but takes account of the requirements laid down by the Commission . 16.02.2011",-5.0,-4.473671,False,False

"AD HOC PUBLICATION pursuant to 15 of the WpHG ( German Securities Trading Act ) Preliminary Figures Financial Year 2010 Strategic Repositioning Brings Results The 2010 fourth quarter with another upswing 2010 consolidated net income increased from EUR-3 .8 million EUR-1 .5 million For 2011 , the company is anticipating a positive result Feldkirchen , 21 February 2011 , Alphaform AG , a specialist in additive manufacturing and a leading company in the area of orthopaedic implants and instruments , on the basis of preliminary figures increased consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter to EUR5 .4 million , a year-on-year increase of 13.5 % against the previous-year figure of EUR4 .8 million . The improvement in the general economic situation generated a rise in incoming orders especially in the Prototyping and Additive Manufacturing business area . And the second business area , Medical Technology , also demonstrated a clear upswing . EBITDA improved in the fourth quarter from EUR-1 .1 million to EUR +0.25 million . Consolidated net income for the fourth quarter improved from EUR-1 .5 million to EUR-0 .2 million ( up 83.8 % ) . Consolidated net income was impacted by write-downs from the acquisition of MediMet in the amount of EUR-0 .2 million ( Q4 2009 EUR-0 .2 million ) . The preliminary figures for financial year 2010 show corporate revenues of EUR20 .3 million , which corresponds to an increase of 4.5 % compared to 2009 . EBITDA increased by 144.2 % , from EUR-1 .4 million in 2009 to EUR0 .63 million during the past financial year . Consolidated net income improved by 61.0 % from EUR3 .8 million in 2009 to EUR-1 .5 million in 2010 . The write-downs on the acquisition of MediMet of EUR1 .9 million that significantly impacted consolidated net income over the last two years will be completed to the end of financial year 2010 . The strategic repositioning already introduced in the spring of 2008 by expanding the Medical Engineering business was successful in 2010 . This business area benefited not only from the general recovery , but also from synergies with the new Alphaform production site in Eschenlohe . The result was revenues growth exceeding 20 % . With Alphaform 's new positioning , the Medical Engineering business area accounts for about 40 % of revenues and has thus become a second pillar of the company . Alphaform anticipates that this share will remain approximately stable over the next year . In the traditional Alphaform area of prototyping , business returned gradually over the course of the year , after having severely declined as a result of the economic crisis . The German automobile manufacturers in the premium segment that are important to Alphaform were more severely impacted by the crisis and thus recovered particularly rapidly . In the fourth quarter , incoming orders for prototyping received by Alphaform again reached the 2008 level . Outlook Assuming a continued healthy economy , Alphaform expects a return to profitability in 2011 . The discontinuation of write-downs from the acquisition of MediMet GmbH means an additional EUR0 .84 million in the result compared to 2010 . If business remains at least stable , Alphaform anticipates a positive result for the current financial year .",-2.285965,-2.631,False,False

"The public prosecutor Stuttgart , Germany has informed yesterday that the investigations against two former management board members of Porsche SE , inter alia because of allegations of share price manipulation , take longer than anticipated . The end of the investigations can be expected at the earliest at the beginning of the year 2012 . The outcome of the investigations is relevant for the valuation of damage claims raised against Porsche SE and based on alleged share price manipulation . This valuation must be made for purposes of the merger of Porsche SE into Volkswagen AG . The legal and tax assessments of the merger of Porsche SE into Volkswagen AG to be made under the basic agreement will likely be delayed . From the management board 's view this also reduces the probability that the merger can be achieved under the timeline of the basic agreement ( which requires that the necessary shareholder resolutions on the merger are made in 2011 ) from previous 70 percent to 50 percent . This has corresponding impacts on the valuation made in Porsche SE 's consolidated financial statements of the put and call options held by Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG in relation to the indirect 50.1 percent stake ( held through a trustee ) in Porsche AG . In view of the Porsche SE management board the overall probability of the merger decreases in case of substantial delays in the merger process compared to the timeline of the basic agreement .

The special items related to impairment losses of around EUR 8.5 million already recognized for turnkey projects as of 30 September 2010 and of around EUR 12.5 million ( of which EUR 4.2 million under EBIT and EUR 8.3 million under net financial expenses ) due to the risk of insolvency at the US customer SpectraWatt . Both developments were already announced as soon as they arose . Moreover , the Group has also recognized further impairment losses of EUR 11.0 million in connection with existing turnkey projects and provisions of EUR 9.6 million for legal and tax risks relating to major projects still underway . Furthermore , as part of a new strategic alignment that , among other aspects , involves streamlining the Group 's product portfolio , the Management Board has discontinued activities in specific product groups and thus also in related development projects . This made it necessary to recognize further , one-off impairment losses of around EUR 3.1 million . One major one-off item of EUR 6.5 million also resulted from the necessary conversion of the accounting treatment of SiNA series single equipment from the percentage of completion method to measurement at cost , which will involve the respective profit being deferred to the 2011 financial year . Further preliminary key figures for the past financial year and information about the Group 's new strategic alignment can be found in the press release also published today . The Annual Report will be published on 31 March 2011 .",-7.911805,-7.672834,False,False

"elexis AG _ Ad hoc disclosure according to Section 15 of the WpHG on the provisional results for the financial year 2010 * Significant increase in order intake giving a book-to-bill ratio of 110 percent * Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) before exceptional items doubled to nearly EUR10 .6 million * Solid balance-sheet ratios , high equity and cashflow approaching pre-crisis levels * Further expansion of international presence in China and continuation of profitable growth planned for 2011 * elexis adjusts goodwill of the segment High Precision Automation ( HEKUMA GmbH ) in the consolidated financial statement by EUR 6,6 million Wenden , 23 February 2011 , According to provisional reports by elexis AG , which is listed on the SDAX of the Frankfurt stock exchange , the company has achieved its target operating results for 2010 before special depreciation . This positive development is due to the high international market presence of the elexis Group and its consistent orientation of the product portfolio to the global megatrends of consumer demand . However , economic success has still been mixed in the various divisions of the elexis Group , depending on the regional structure of its business model . The significantly positive earnings position of the High Quality Automation segment contrasts sharply with the negative result of the High Precision Automation division in 2010 . Order intake and sales Q4 2010 followed on from the positive trend of the first nine months . During the financial year , the Group recorded a provisional order intake of EUR150 .7 million ( previous year EUR119 .3 million ) . This represents growth of approximately 26 percent . According to provisional and not finally audited financial statements , sales rose in the year ending by around 8 percent to EUR136 ,7 million ( previous year EUR127 .0 million ) . This is equivalent to a provisional change in the book-to-bill ratio from 94 percent in the previous year to 110 percent . During the period under review , the direct export quota was 58.2 percent ( previous year 50.9 percent ) and reinforced the high international presence of the elexis Group . BRIC states in particular were the main driving force behind this growth . Growth in the divisions According to provisional reports , the High Quality Automation division recorded an order intake of EUR125 .9 million ( previous year EUR105 .5 million ) . Foreign subsidiaries of elexis AG in China , Brazil and India made a significant contribution to this sharp rise . The High Quality Automation division contributed EUR118 .0 million to the sales of the elexis Group ( previous year EUR113 .7 million ) . However , the High Precision Automation division was not yet able to profit from the growth in emerging countries . So far the customer structure has focused for the most part on industrialised nations where investments have been affected by the demand for replacement investments . Despite this , the division almost doubled its provisional order intake to the balance-sheet date to EUR24 .8 million ( previous year EUR13 .7 million ) . Sales rose to EUR18 .7 million ( previous year EUR13 .4 million ) according to provisional figures . Earnings position EBIT before exceptional items reported a significant year-on-year increase , almost doubling the previous year 's figures . According to provisional figures , EBIT for the financial year under review amounted to EUR10 .6 million ( previous year EUR5 .4 million ) before taking account of the write-down to going-concern value of HEKUMA GmbH . The EBIT margin before exceptional items amounted subject to final results of the consolidated financial statements to 7.7 percent compared with 4.2 percent in the previous year according to provisional figures . After deprecation , EBIT is expected to be EUR4 .0 million or 2.9 percent . According to provisional figures , the net annual profit before depreciation of goodwill was EUR6 .4 million . Earnings after interest and taxes ( Group net income for the period after deducting minority interests ) is expected to be EUR1 .8 million after exceptional items compared to EUR1 .7 million in the previous year . As a result of this earnings per share amounted as at 31 December 2010 to EUR0 .20 , almost returning to the previous year 's level ( previous year EUR0 .19 ) . Adjustment goodwill of HEKUMA GmbH According to provisional figures , the consolidated earnings position of elexis AG during the financial year under review was affected by a write-down to going-concern value of HEKUMA GmbH in the amount of EUR6 .6 million . HEKUMA GmbH , taken over in the year 2000 , represents the High Precision Automation division . The product portfolio in this division specialises in highly-automated production processes , which are predominantly used in industrialised nations . Industrial manufacturing is becoming increasingly important in BRIC states , particularly in China . Due to these regional market shifts and new product requirements , the High Precision Automation segment offers new opportunities for future growth particularly in these countries . It is assumed that the return to previous high levels of earning power ( EBIT ) 10 percent ) in this division will take some time yet . In addition , the results of the impairment calculation were affected by the historically low interest rate . elexis exhibited an economically conservative approach in the adaptation of the firm value . The write-down has no effect on payment and does not have an effect on the dividend capacity of elexis . The subsidiary is expected to achieve a positive EBIT in the 1st quarter of 2011 , as well as expanding its international presence to an increased extent , playing a part in designing new industrial automation processes in the global markets . The focus here will be on strategic partnerships and expanding cooperations and networks . Solid liquidity Equity before exceptional items rose , according to provisional reports , from EUR66 .9 million in the previous year to EUR73 .6 million at 31 December 2010 . The Group 's provisional equity ratio , adjusted for exceptional items , amounted to 53.8 percent ( previous year 51.6 percent ) . After deprecation , equity for the financial year under review is expected to be EUR69 .1 million or 52.2 percent . According to provisional reports , cashflow almost returned to pre-crisis levels at EUR14 .6 million ( previous year EUR5 .8 million ) . Outlook Clear strategy for growth and market leadership through international presence In view of the current shift in demand , the current international presence of the elexis Group underlines the positive outlook for 2011 . China will continue to remain a key market for the future . Thanks to the construction of a new business center in Shanghai , the elexis Group is strengthening its market presence in Asia as an international technology company . This will ensure that all product divisions of the elexis Group are now represented in China . Together with production facilities in China , Brazil and India , the elexis Group will continue to expand its market leadership throughout 2011 with innovative excellence and product expertise and is expecting sustained profitable growth . elexis will report on the final results for the financial year 2010 on 23 March 2011 with the publication of its financial report . Shares of elexis AG are listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange ( ISIN DE 000 508 500 5 ) . Elexis AG is included in the SDAX index . 23.02.2011",-2.76596,-2.991344,False,False

An overall average bulk density of 2.51 tonnes per cubic metre has been used for the tonnage estimation . 4 . Gold equivalent grade is calculated at a silver gold ratio of 60 1 , using metallurgical recoveries of 88 % for gold and 83 % for silver and metal prices as stated in Note 2 . 5 . The resources are reported at a 3 g_t gold equivalent cut-off grade . This case is shown in bold text in the Table above . 6 . The estimated mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability . 7 . Numbers have been rounded in all categories to reflect the precision of the estimates . 8 . The mineral resources were estimated by Hochschild using the ordinary kriging capability of MineSite software to estimate metal grades for the main vein body and inverse distance to the power of three for the peripheral veins . A block size of 10m by 5m by 10m in size was used and outlier high grades were top-cut to 30 g_t for gold and 860 g_t for silver . The Inmaculada mineral resource estimate has been estimated by Hochschild and classified in accordance with CIM guidelines and reviewed by IMZ 's Qualified Person Nick Appleyard and the estimate has an effective date of February 24 , 2011 . The mineral resource estimate is based on the results of 240 core drill holes for approximately 71,000 meters ( 'm ' ) of drilling , which have defined a strike length to the Angela Vein mineralization of approximately 2 Km ( which is still open to the northeast ) and a vertical extent of over 300m . On December 28 , 2010 , IMZ signed a definitive agreement with Hochschild to fast track production at the Inmaculada project , whereby Hochschild have committed to building a mining operation at Inmaculada with a process capacity of 3,000 tonnes per day ( unless the parties agree that such capacity is not optimal ) by December 2013 , subject to any unforeseen delays under defined ` force majeure ' conditions . Hochschild will provide 100 % of the initial $ 100 million of funding required to complete a feasibility study and the planning , development and construction of a mining operation at Inmaculada . Any subsequent expenditures will be funded 60 % by Hochschild and 40 % by IMZ . Resource Estimation Methodology The resource estimation was constrained using a 1.6 g_t gold equivalent wireframe to outline the mineralized zone . The wireframe was constructed from cross-sectional interpretation of the Angela Vein deposit by Hochschild geologists and included splays ( or branches ) from the main vein . A search ellipse with a radius of 75m , sub-divided into quadrants , was then used to interpolate grades based on 1m downhole composites , into the 10m by 5m by 10m blocks that were aligned with the strike of the Angela vein , using the ordinary kriging capability of MineSite software . Resources were classified in the Measured Category for all blocks that met two criteria 1 ) at least one sample within 25m ( one third of the variogram range ) , 2 ) samples from at least four quadrants . Resources were classified in the Indicated category when at least two samples were within 50m ( two thirds of the variogram range ) . Resources for all other blocks within the range of the variogram were classified in the Inferred category .",-1.589409,-1.787953,False,False

"Today , on February 28 , 2011 , the Executive Board of STADA Arzneimittel AG , based on the preliminary results for financial year 2010 took a resolution on the dividend proposal for the past financial year . The Executive Board also adopted a positive outlook for financial years 2011 and 2012 . Preliminary key figures for the Group for 2010 According to the preliminary results , Group sales are expected to have increased in 2010 , with continuing mixed development in individual national markets , by approx . 4 _ to approx . EUR 1,627.0 million . Despite difficult framework conditions in individual national markets , particularly in Serbia and Germany , all operational key earnings figures , i.e. without consideration of the significant earnings-burdening , one-time special effects are expected to have increased in financial year 2010 . Adjusted earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( adjusted EBITDA ) recorded strong growth of an anticipated approx . 10 _ to approx . EUR 315.9 million and thus achieves the highest value in the Company history . Adjusted net income is expected to have increased by approx . 15 _ to approx . EUR 133.3 million . The adjustments include one-time special effects as well as non-operational effects from currency influences and interest rate hedge transactions . In view of this increase in the adjusted key figures for the Group , financial year 2010 , in the view of the Executive Board , can be considered operationally successful for STADA . Due , however , to the known high one-time special effects particularly in the third quarter of 2010 , reported net income in 2010 , like the other reported key earnings figures of the Group for 2010 , will , as expected , decrease considerably and fall by approx . 32 _ to approx . EUR 68.4 million . One-time special effects in financial year 2010 amounted to a total burden on earnings in the expected amount of approx . EUR 79.9 million before or approx . EUR 66.7 million after taxes ( previous year net burden on earnings due to one-time special effects in the amount of EUR 17.3 million before or EUR 12.5 million after taxes ) . Non-operational effects from currency influences and interest rate hedge transactions amounted to a relief on earnings in 2010 in the expected total amount of approx . EUR 2.7 million before or approx . EUR 1.9 million after taxes ( previous year net burden on earnings due to non-operational effects from currency influences and interest rate hedge transactions in the amount of EUR 4.2 million before or EUR 2.8 million after taxes ) . Taking into account these adjustments results in the following expected development of the reported and adjusted key earnings figures _ pre class _ ` news_table_1234 ' _ In EUR million ( approximate values ) 2010 2009 __ - _ Operating profit 161.8 191.9 -16 _ Operating profit , adjusted 239.3 211.1 _ 13 _ EBITDA 268.8 280.1 -4 _ EBITDA , adjusted 315.9 287.5 _ 10 _ Net income 68.4 100.4 -32 _ Net income , adjusted 133.3 115.8 _ 15 _ Earnings per share in EUR 1.16 1.71 -32 _ Earnings per share in EUR , adjusted 2.27 1.97 _ 15 _ __ pre class _ ` news_table_1234 ' _ As of December 31 , 2010 , net debt is expected to have decreased to approx . EUR 864.1 million ( December 31 , 2009 EUR 899.0 million ) . The net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is expected to have decreased to 2.7 in 2010 ( previous year 3.1 ) and was thus significantly below the maximum value of 3 strived for by the Executive Board . Dividend proposal The Executive Board proposes to the Supervisory Board that they recommend to the next Annual General Meeting on June 16 , 2011 , to plan for a distribution ratio for financial year 2010 unchanged from the previous year of approx . 32 _ of net income . This corresponds to a dividend proposal of EUR 0.37 ( previous year EUR 0.55 per STADA common share ) . The proposed total dividend payments amount to EUR 21.7 million ( previous year EUR 32.3 million ) . With this proposed resolution , the Executive Board aims to give shareholders a share in net income , without placing too great a restriction on the Group 's financial flexibility for further growth . Outlook In addition , the Executive Board today confirmed its generally positive outlook for the further development of the STADA Group .

"Raisio plc Stock Exchange Release 28 February 2011 at 12 Finnish time New study The cholesterol-lowering ingredient of Benecol products , plant stanol ester , shows double maximal cholesterol-lowering efficacy compared to plant sterol ester A new meta-analysis1 ) shows that the maximal LDL-cholesterol reduction achievable with plant stanol ester is double that seen when plant sterol ester is used . Plant stanol ester is the cholesterol-lowering ingredient unique to Benecol ( R ) products . In addition , plant stanol ester produces additional and dose-dependent reductions in LDL-cholesterol with intakes above current recommendations ( 2 g plant stanols_sterols per day ) . For plant sterol ester , no such effect was evident . These new data were published in the scientific journal Prostaglandins , Leukotrienes , and Essential Fatty Acids . The meta-analysis by Musa-Veloso et al .1 ) was based on a large number of scientific studies and included 182 data sets in total . The analysis showed that the estimated maximal LDL-cholesterol reduction was 18.2 % for plant stanol ester versus 9.1 % for plant sterol ester , with the difference between the two reaching statistical significance . The findings of the new meta-analysis are supported by two recently published independent clinical studies showing LDL-cholesterol reductions of approximately 17 % with a daily consumption of 9g plant stanols2 ) , 3 ) . ` It is known that plant stanols and plant sterols have different structures and that they behave differently in the body , and so it was important to study the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effects of the two substances separately ' , says Kathy Musa-Veloso PhD , the principle author of the article . ` The results of the meta-analysis indicate that intakes of plant stanols in excess of 2 g_day , in fact , up to 9 g_day , are associated with further and dose-dependent reductions in LDL-cholesterol . For plant sterols , however , we did not find a dose-response . ' Several scientific and authoritative bodies recommend a daily consumption of plant stanols or plant sterols for improving blood cholesterol levels . The new data may have significant implications for current practices . ` The relationship between reductions in LDL-cholesterol and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease is near to linear . In other words , the lower the LDL cholesterol , the lower the risk . These new results are clinically very important as the boosted effect of plant stanol ester with elevated daily intakes may further intensify the coronary heart disease risk reduction at a population level ' , concludes MD , professor Helena Gylling from the University of Helsinki in Finland . ` No other single dietary means has proven to be as effective and easy in reducing cholesterol as the daily intake of sufficient amounts of plant stanol ester-containing Benecol foods . ' ` The new findings are great news for consumers and for Benecol , as all Benecol products are made with plant stanol ester . Benecol consumers can now be confident that they have selected the most effective food ingredient to lower their cholesterol . In the cholesterol-lowering foods category , the efficacy of the products has a huge influence on consumer choices . With these superior results Benecol can further strengthen its position in the market as well as enter new market areas ' , says Matti Rihko , CEO of the Raisio Group . Benecol is one of the world leaders in cholesterol-lowering foods and only Benecol products contain plant stanol ester . Plant stanol ester is the cholesterol-lowering food ingredient patented globally by Raisio and Benecol ( R ) is a global trademark owned by Raisio . Benecol products are sold and marketed by Raisio 's wide network of partners on five continents and in more than 30 countries .

Digia 's view on the impact of Nokia 's new strategy on Digia 's Mobile Solutions business is based , thus far , largely on the information released by Nokia and the assessments made thereof . The company finds it evident , however , that service sales to Nokia in Symbian and Meego technologies will fall below the level of 2010 to such a degree that the company will , most probably , not be able to recover the loss of sales entirely through new accounts or additional sales efforts to existing customers . In consequence , the company will probably not be able to pursue growth in net sales in the current situation and , the company 's net sales will decline compared to the figures of 2010 . The company estimates that , in the first quarter of 2011 , the net sales of Mobile Solutions segment will remain equal to the 2010 and , thereafter , decrease from the level of 2010 . Nokia Plc. 's strategy revision will have no direct impact on the major part of Digia 's business , namely , the Enterprise Solutions segment . It is likely that first-quarter net sales of the Enterprise Solutions segment will settle at the level of 2010 , primarily because of licence sales being lower than expected . As regards the rest of the year , the company estimates that net sales of the Enterprise Solutions segment will develop , at a minimum , in line with general market growth . For these reasons , the company is not able at this point to present a more detailed estimate of the group-level net sales for the entire year . At least over the short term , the company will have difficulty in maintaining its desired profitability level of ten ( 10 ) per cent ( EBIT % ) , because of the declining net sales of the Mobile Solutions segment and the rising cost and salary levels in both business segments . The company estimates the profitability of the Mobile Solutions segment to be 5-7 % in the first quarter . The company estimates the profitability of the Enterprise Solutions segment at 8-10 % for the first quarter , affected particularly by the temporary decrease in licence sales in proportion to net sales during the beginning of the year . The profitability of the Enterprise Solutions segment is nevertheless expected to develop positively for the remainder of 2011 .

Compared to 2009 , sales dropped by 5.0 % to 3,307.9 million EUR , the EBITDA fell by 15.4 % , the operating result sank by 20.5 % to 828.5 million EUR , and the group result was reduced by 37.8 % to 400.8 million EUR . The controlling group ratios developed as follows The EBIT margin sank from 29.9 % to 25.0 % , the gearing saw an improvement from 140.4 % to 96.8 % , and the operating cash flow decreased from 968.0 EUR to 778.2 million EUR . A dividend of 0.55 EUR_share will be proposed at the annual shareholder 's meeting on 13 April 2011 .

Previous year figures have been adjusted . ** 2009 dividend included a special dividend of 0,25 EUR per share Water Supply , Wholesale Prices and One-Off Effects Put a Strain on the Result The weaker water supply from rivers , in comparison to 2009 , has had a negative impact on the results since VERBUND generates some 90 % of the electricity in Austria from hydro power . Although , at 0.99 , the hydro coefficient only lay at 1.0 % under the long term average , it was 7.0 % points under that of the previous year . However , it was possible to compensate for the inferior , weather-related , generation from the run-of-river power plants by means of the 2009 acquisition of the Bavarian Inn power plants . The production of the annual reservoir power plants sank by 9.7 % on account of the significant decline in inflows compared to 2009 . In 2010 , VERBUND generated 26,708 GWh from hydro power , including procurement rights , amounting to some 1.4 % less than 2009 . By way of contrast , thermal generation rose by 56.9 % to 4,258 GWh . A determining factor for this was the higher thermal own generation , as well as the pro-rata production of electricity from the POWEO power plant , Pont-sur-Sambre , which has been in operation since the end of September 2009 . In addition , the result was considerably influenced by the extremely weak development of the wholesale prices . Traded in 2009 , the relevant prices for fiscal 2010 of the electricity forward contract , ` Year Base 2010 ' , thus lay , at an average 49.2 EUR_MWh , 30.0 % below the previous year 's level . The prices for the front year peak contracts , traded in 2009 , sank over the 2009 annual average by 29.8 % to 69.8 EUR_MWh . In contrast , somewhat higher prices were again realized on the spot market in 2010 . At 52.1 EUR_MWh , the average achieved contract price achieved by VERBUND for 2010 was 9.2 EUR_MWh below that of the previous year . In 2010 , the development of VERBUND results were also swayed by one-off effects . With some 30 million EUR , they had an impact on the operating result , as well as on the financial result . Capital Increase Powers Investment in Hydropower A milestone in VERBUND 's history was the capital increase to the tune of some 1 billion EUR , which was carried out on 24 November 2010 . The new capital enabled the further rapid implementation of the planned investments on the basis of a solid capital structure and an ` A ' rating . The next six years will see VERBUND investing 2.4 billion EUR in growth projects , such as the large pumped storage power plants Limberg II in Salzburg and Reisseck II in Carinthia . In addition , the expansion of Austria 's high voltage grid is being further pushed ahead and investment in Turkey continued . Outlook Based upon an average water supply , roughly the same results are being anticipated for fiscal 2011 . The dividend policy continues to be oriented on a constant dividend payout ratio of between 45 and 50 % of the group result .

The estimated overall need for reductions in personnel is at most 18 jobs . The decision to start negotiations was made in the light of the operational changes required by the Marimekko Group 's Finnish online retailing project as well as measures aimed at enhancing the general cost-effectiveness of warehousing operations . At present , goods deliveries are handled by two main warehouses . The company 's aim is to boost the efficiency of warehousing operations and to consolidate them in a single location . In this way , e-commerce deliveries could also be handled most smoothly and profitably . ` We find it very regrettable that we have to go through a process like this , which is difficult for Marimekko employees . E-commerce is becoming more and more common , and our project for this is essential for the development of our business . Since we have decided to invest in e-commerce , we are also obliged to see how all related operations could be arranged in the best possible way . Delivering goods from two main warehouses is not a workable solution for e-commerce and it is n't cost-effective from the viewpoint of other deliveries either . For this reason we aim to consolidate the warehousing operations in a single location , ' says President and CEO Mika Ihamuotila . In the course of the negotiations , it will be determined how much the reduction in functions can be compensated for by transfers within the Group and whether pensions or special arrangements can be used .

In view of the currently outstanding 6.8 million shares , preliminary earnings per share came to EUR 0.31 compared to EUR 0.52 in 2009 . The result mainly dropped because of the expected reduction of the forfaiting margin . At the same time , the forfaiting volume was not increased to the required extent . The forfaiting margin fell from 2.4 % , a record value achieved in the previous year on account of the financial crisis , to 1.8 % in 2010 . Although the forfaiting volume went up by 13 % to EUR 650 million ( previous year EUR 576 million ) , this was not enough to compensate for the drop in margin . Consequently , the gross result including financial results , the multiplication of margin and volume , went down from EUR 14.0 million to EUR 11.8 million . The efficiency improvement measures in sales launched in fall 2010 started showing first effects in the second half of the fourth quarter . Between October and December , the forfaiting volume increased from EUR 150 million in the previous quarter to EUR 165 million .

"Ad-hoc-Release , 9 March 2011 From Stabilisation to Expansion EADS Reports 2010 Full Year Results , All key indicators above guidance , Order intake increased 81 percent to EUR 83.1 billion , driven by Airbus Commercial , Revenues up 7 percent ( EUR 45.8 billion ) with record deliveries of 510 commercial aircraft , EBIT * before one-off EUR 1.3 billion , Free Cash Flow of EUR 2.7 billion , much stronger than expected , Return to dividend , proposal of EUR 0.22 per share , Net income EUR 553 million ( EPS EUR 0.68 per share ) , Record net cash position of EUR 11.9 billion EADS ' ( stock exchange symbol EAD ) annual results of the Group 's 10th anniversary year 2010 demonstrate significant achievements supported by the recovery of the macro-economic and commercial environment which was stronger than expected . Institutional markets including helicopters , defense and public budgets still have to be monitored as well as potential risks linked to oil and commodity prices , air traffic in North Africa and continued currency issues . In 2010 , the order intake ( 4 ) amounted to EUR 83.1 billion , driven by improved momentum in commercial aviation . EADS ' order book of more than EUR 448 billion provides a solid platform for future deliveries . Revenues reached a new high at EUR 45.8 billion . Likewise , profitability and cash performance were better than expected . The EBIT * before one-off of EUR 1.3 billion benefited from the better underlying performance than expected in Airbus legacy programs and other core business activities . The reported EBIT * amounted to EUR 1.2 billion . The Net Cash position of EUR 11.9 billion is higher than anticipated , thanks to better cash management and higher order intake . It is a key asset to foster future growth . ' 2010 was a year of significant progress for EADS . Commercial aircraft orders exceeded expectations and our cash flow generation was excellent . We took huge steps forward in managing and controlling key programs A400M has been substantially de-risked and A380 production is improving steadily ' , said Louis Gallois , CEO of EADS . ` At the same time , we are paying the closest attention to the A350 program , to the evolution of defense and space budgets and to the recovery of the helicopter market . After take-off into our second decade of operations , a key priority for us now is to further improve profitability in future years to lay a solid foundation for sustainable growth . ' In 2010 , EADS ' revenues increased 7 percent to EUR 45.8 billion ( FY 2009 EUR 42.8 billion ) thanks to growth from both volume and mix effects across core businesses , reduced by a negative foreign exchange impact of around EUR 500 million . Physical deliveries remained at a high level with 510 aircraft at Airbus Commercial , 527 helicopters at Eurocopter and the 41st consecutive successful Ariane 5 launch . The percentage-of-completion methodology was resumed on the A400M program based on the allocation of internal milestones . This has resulted in revenues of around EUR 1 billion being booked on the program with zero margin due to the associated provision utilisation . The Customer Nations and EADS have concluded negotiations on the overall A400M discussions . Following the approval in France and Germany , negotiations on the export levy facility ( ELF ) scheme are to be finalized with some Customer Nations and are targeted for completion in 2011 . In the meantime , the program is delivering results with four development aircraft flying . The A400M maturity gate milestone was passed in February 2011 , which clears the way for the start of series production . Civil certification is planned for 2011 . EBIT * before one-off ( adjusted EBIT * ) , an indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding non-recurring charges or profits caused by movements in provisions or foreign exchange impacts , stood at EUR 1.3 billion ( FY 2009 EUR 2.2 billion ) for EADS and at around EUR 280 million for Airbus . It benefited from good underlying performance in all core business activities in the Divisions , especially the Airbus legacy programs . Compared to 2009 , EBIT * before one-off was weighed down by the deterioration of hedge rates ( FY2009 ~ EUR 1 = $ 1.26 versus FY2010 ~ EUR 1 = $ 1.35 ) . As expected , A380 continues to weigh significantly on the EBIT * before one-off . EADS ' reported EBIT * stood at EUR 1,231 million ( FY 2009 EUR -322 million ) . In 2010 , EADS has further refined its natural hedging strategy , impacting reported EBIT * and other financial result but with no impact on EBIT * before one-off and Net Income . Net Income amounted to EUR 553 million ( FY 2009 EUR -763 million ) , or earnings per share of EUR 0.68 ( earnings per share FY 2009 EUR -0.94 ) . The finance result amounts to EUR -371 million ( FY 2009 EUR -592 million ) . The interest result of EUR -99 million ( FY 2009 EUR -147 million ) mainly reflects lower interest expenses . Meanwhile , the other financial result improved considerably by around EUR 170 million year-on-year to EUR -272 million ( FY 2009 EUR -445 million ) driven mainly by lower unwinding of discounted provisions in 2010 than in 2009 . The unwinding of discount mainly decreases due to lower outstanding provisions . Based on an Earnings per Share ( EPS ) of EUR 0.68 , the EADS Board of Directors proposes payment on 6 June 2011 of a dividend of EUR 0.22 cents per share to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders ( exceptionally , due to the significant loss incurred in 2009 , no dividend payment was made that year ) . The record date should be 3 June 2011 . ` We are pleased to resume paying a dividend to our loyal shareholders . The Group 's performance in 2010 merits the proposed dividend . It is our clear ambition to gradually improve profitability in the mid-term . Profitability improvement is the key indicator for a better dividend distribution in the future , ' said Hans Peter Ring , CFO of EADS . Self-financed Research and Development ( R and D ) expenses reached EUR 2,939 million ( FY 2009 EUR 2,825 million ) , driven mainly by increases at Cassidian for the Unmanned Aerial Systems ( UAS ) and Systems businesses and at Eurocopter across the product range . At Airbus , the increase in R and D on the A350 XWB was compensated by decreases in other programs , especially the A380 and A330-200F . Free Cash Flow before customer financing of EUR 2,644 million ( FY 2009 EUR 991 million ) is significantly above expectations thanks to better operational and inventory management performance and stronger pre delivery payments at Airbus Commercial than expected . The improvement compared to last year is driven by the working capital . At Airbus Commercial , inventory reduction is driven by delivery patterns . The inflow of advances linked to Airbus commercial activity in 2010 was stronger than expected and was above 2009 , particularly in the fourth quarter , reflecting the increase in future deliveries and commercial aircraft orders . This positive effect was more than offset by lower advance payments at Astrium and Cassidian compared to the 2009 level which was driven by exceptional order intake booked that year . Due to a combination of appetite from lessors and banking market recovery , customer financing generated a positive contribution of around EUR 60 million compared to a 2009 outflow of EUR 400 million . Investing activities consumed around EUR 2.3 billion , mainly as investment ramps up on the A350 XWB program . Free Cash Flow after customer financing amounted to EUR 2,707 million ( FY 2009 EUR 585 million ) . EADS ' Net Cash position amounted to EUR 11.9 billion ( year-end 2009 EUR 9.8 billion ) after a EUR 553 million contribution to pension fund assets . It continues to be a solid foundation for the Group 's operational needs as well as future growth . The Group 's order intake ( 4 ) of EUR 83.1 billion was significantly higher than one year ago ( FY 2009 EUR 45.8 billion ) , driven by the higher level of commercial aircraft orders at Airbus . Net orders of 574 aircraft include 32 A380s and 78 A350 XWB . By the end of December 2010 , EADS ' order book ( 4 ) stood at a record EUR 448.5 billion ( year-end 2009 EUR 389.1 billion ) , reflecting the improved commercial aircraft momentum . The Airbus Commercial order book also benefited from a positive revaluation impact of around EUR 25 billion due to the strengthening value of the U.S. dollar against the euro at the end of December 2010 compared to the end of December 2009 . The defense order book stood at EUR 58.3 billion ( year-end 2009 EUR 57.3 billion ) . At the end of December 2010 , EADS ' workforce consisted of 121,691 employees ( year-end 2009 119,506 ) . Outlook EADS ' 2011 guidance is based on an assumption of EUR 1 = $ 1.35 for average and year-end closing spot rates . In 2011 , Airbus should deliver 520 to 530 commercial aircraft and its gross orders should be above its deliveries . EADS ' 2011 revenues should be above the 2010 revenues . EADS expects 2011 EBIT * before one-off to remain stable compared to the 2010 level , at around EUR 1.3 billion . Increasing volume and price improvement at Airbus Commercial are roughly compensated by the deterioration of hedge rates , increasing R and D and less favourable mix of activities at Cassidian . Going forward , the reported EBIT * and EPS performance of EADS will be dependent on the Group 's ability to execute on the A400M , A380 and A350 XWB programs , in line with the commitments made to its customers . Reported EBIT * and EPS also depend on exchange rate fluctuations . At EUR 1 = $ 1.35 , EADS expects 2011 EPS to be above the 2010 level of EUR 0.68 . Free Cash Flow is expected to be positive . It is the most volatile item and EADS will give a more precise guidance later in the year . In 2012 , the Group expects a significant improvement in its EBIT * before one off thanks to higher volume , better pricing and improvement of A380 performance at Airbus . * EADS uses EBIT pre goodwill impairment and exceptionals as a key indicator of its economic performance . The term ` exceptionals ' refers to such items as depreciation expenses of fair value adjustments relating to the EADS merger , the Airbus Combination and the formation of MBDA , as well as impairment charges thereon . EADS is a global leader in aerospace , defense and related services . In 2010 , the Group , comprising Airbus , Astrium , Cassidian and Eurocopter , generated revenues of EUR 45.8 billion and employed a workforce of nearly 122,000 .",1.108868,1.689138,True,True

According to provisional figures , REALTECH 's Group revenue in fiscal year 2010 rose 8 % to EUR 52.5 million ( 2009 EUR 48.7 million ) . At EUR 13.7 million ( EUR 11.7 million ) software solutions saw growth of 17 % . The consulting business area reported a rise in revenues of 5 % to EUR 38.8 million ( EUR 37.0 million ) . It must be noted here that REALTECH AG sold its Italian subsidiary , REALTECH Italia S.p. A , Agrate Brianza ( Milan ) , on December 14 , 2010 as part of a management buy-out . In line with IFRS regulations , the Italian company is being listed as ` Discontinued Operations ' ( ` Aufgegebene Geschäftsbereiche ' ) . As a result , the figures for 2010 and 2009 are shown excluding REALTECH Italia . Earnings before interest , tax , depreciation , and amortization ( EBITDA ) climbed by 81 % to EUR 6.7 million ( EUR 3.7 million ) , while EBIT rose by 70 % to EUR 4.4 million ( EUR 2.6 million ) . The software business area directly accounted for a 69 % share of Group EBIT ( previous year 66 % ) . Accordingly , the consulting business area contributed a 31 % share ( previous year 34 % ) . In contrast , if we take REALTECH Italia into account ` pro forma ' as part of the Group for the two years to be compared , EBITDA for fiscal year 2010 is EUR 3.9 million ( EUR 3.7 million ) and EBIT is EUR 3.0 million ( EUR 2.6 million ) . At minus EUR 1.5 million ( EUR 1.2 million ) net income was greatly influenced by the disposal of the Italian subsidiary . Accordingly , earnings per share were minus EUR 0.27 ( EUR 0.23 ) . Net cash and cash equivalents were EUR 6.4 million ( EUR 6.6 million ) . Cash flow rose to EUR 6.5 million ( EUR 5.1 million ) . 4th quarter of 2010 Group revenue rose by 25 % to EUR 15.7 million ( Q4_2009 EUR 12.5 million ) . Software revenues climbed by 75 % to EUR 5.7 million ( EUR 3.2 million ) . Consulting achieved growth of 8 % to EUR 10.0 million ( EUR 9.3 million ) .

Net income was minus EUR 3.0 million ( EUR 0.8 million ) , corresponding to earnings per share of minus EUR 0.56 ( EUR 0.15 ) . ` We are satisfied with the way business has developed in 2010 . However , the general economic situation has made the year that has just past extremely challenging . The fact that the company 's performance is in line with and , in some cases , even better than our forecast at the beginning of 2010 is thanks to our highly dedicated employees , ' explained Nicola Glowinski , Chief Executive Officer of REALTECH AG . ` Back in 2009 we introduced measures to reduce costs and we were able to reap the benefit of this in 2010 . ' Nicola Glowinski continued ` Next year , too , we are planning to continue to systematically focus our company 's activities on economically successful regions . In 2011 we will concentrate our efforts in developing our core business , ' explained Glowinski . ` Both the more intensive development and sales partnerships with SAP and the planned expansion of software products into further regions demand renewed efforts and require additional financial investment . However , profitable growth remains top priority and we will clearly build on this in the next few years , ' Nicola Glowinski concluded . REALTECH AG 's annual financial statements form the basis for a resolution to be passed during the General Meeting on the appropriation of earnings . REALTECH AG 's net income was greatly influenced by the sale of the equity investment in REALTECH Italia S. p. A. and the investments made with a view to future growth . REALTECH AG 's retained earnings in the year under review were EUR 0 thousand , compared to EUR 3,016 thousand in 2009 . To compensate for the retained profits brought forward from the previous year and the net loss in excess of this , EUR 2.742 thousand was withdrawn from the paid-in capital . For this reason , the Executive and Supervisory Boards are not able to propose a dividend at the General Meeting in Wiesloch on May 24 , 2011 .

"Sponda Plc Stock Exchange Release 10 March 2011 , 2 00 p.m. Sponda is developing an environmentally friendly office building for Talentum The property investment company Sponda Plc and Talentum Plc have signed an agreement on an office building to be developed in the Ruoholahti district of Helsinki . Talentum 's head office will move to the new premises from Kamppi in Helsinki . The new development will comprise nearly 6,000 square metres of floor space at Itämerenkatu 23 , a location currently occupied by the Kuntotalo building . Over 70 per cent of the building will be leased to Talentum . Construction of the office building is set to begin in August 2011 and the project is scheduled for completion in April 2013 . The project 's total investment is estimated at approximately EUR 23.5 million , inclusive of the value of the current building at the location , which will be demolished . The first phase of the project will be the demolition of the Kuntotalo building . Built in 1976 , the Kuntotalo building was originally intended for use as a recreational facility for the personnel of the state-run alcohol retail monopoly Alko . In subsequent years the building has also been used , among other things , as a school and a swimming hall . The building is in poor condition and will be demolished . The basement levels , however , will be retained , with the new building constructed on top of them . The basement levels will house the parking facility for the new office building . Energy efficiency and environmentally friendly solutions will be emphasised in the design and construction of the new four-storey building . Particular attention will be paid to optimising energy consumption during the use of the building by choosing housing solutions with the least environmental impact . International environmental certification will be sought for the building . Upon completion , it will also be part of Sponda 's energy efficiency program , which is Sponda 's initiative for striving for energy conservation in partnership with its clients . The location of the office in the vicinity of the metro station offers excellent public transportation connections . This further enables the use of environmentally friendly alternatives to commuting in private cars . Sponda has numerous property development projects in progress The recovery in the demand for commercial premises in late 2010 has resulted in increased activity in Sponda 's property development operations . In the beginning of 2011 the company began work on expanding the Zeppelin shopping complex in Oulu . Another new project nearing its launch is the renovation of an office and retail premises building on Hämeenkatu in Tampere . In addition to these , Sponda 's active projects include the renovation of the City-Center business and shopping complex in Helsinki 's central business district . Work was completed in late February on a new production facility for Metso in the Hakkila district of Vantaa .

"March 11 , 2011 Dyckerhoff Group net profit clearly decreased as a result of price declines and extraordinary write-downs in the USA Dividend proposal EUR 0.50 per ordinary shares and preferred shares each Following the adoption of the annual financial statements of Dyckerhoff AG as at December 31 , 2010 , and after the approval of the consolidated financial statements as at December 31 , 2010 , the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Dyckerhoff AG have just decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting on May 10 , 2011 the payment of a dividend of EUR 0.50 ( 2009 EUR 1.00 ) per ordinary share and per preferred share each for the financial year 2010 . In fiscal year 2010 Group sales increased by EUR 43.6 million or 3.2 % to about EUR 1.413 billion , in comparison to previous year . To this growth changes in the group of consolidated companies contributed EUR 36.3 million , and positive exchange rate effects EUR 40.7 million . Volumes of cement , ready-mixed concrete , and aggregates increased in all markets except for the Czech Republic and the USA . Average prices for our cements and concretes fell almost everywhere . Price falls were highest in Russia , at almost 18 % . Adjusted for changes in the group of consolidated companies and exchange rate variances , Group sales fell by 2.4 % . About 51 % of total Group sales can be ascribed to Germany _ Western Europe , 35 % to Eastern Europe and 14 % to the USA . Group EBITDA fell by EUR 75.9 million , or 25.8 % , to EUR 218.6 million . This includes negative one-time effects of a total of EUR 10.6 million , mainly for expenses in relation to the capacity expansion at the Suchoi Log plant in Russia , and to the ` mothballing ' of the US plant Oglesby . This compares to positive one-time effects of EUR 22.8 million in 2009 , essentially from the release of provisions . Changes to the group of consolidated companies had no significant effect , they accounted for positive EUR 1 million . Exchange rate effects boosted EBITDA by EUR 9.3 million . The result before income taxes fell to EUR -20.5 million ( 2009 EUR 143.1 million ) . EUR 78.0 million of this decline is due to the aforementioned measures in the Oglesby plant in the USA . The result after income taxes is EUR 14.2 million , Group net profit is EUR 6.4 million . Both results are reduced mainly by extraordinary write-downs on the production facilities in Oglesby of EUR 48.3 million after taxes . Equity ratio increased to 50.4 % ( 2009 47.9 % ) . Net debt went up to EUR 398.0 million ( 2009 EUR 303.8 million ) , and Gearing increased to 23.8 % ( 2009 18.9 % ) . For the year 2011 Dyckerhoff expects Group sales of EUR 1.5 billion . This is mainly based on the assumption to be confirmed that some price increases will be accepted by the market . Dyckerhoff expects to significantly increase EBITDA and reach an EBITDA margin of around 17 % .

"Componenta Corporation Stock Exchange Release 14 March 2011 at 14.00 Componenta 's statutory personnel negotiations that began on 25 January 2011 at its Pietarsaari business unit have been completed . As the result of these negotiations , it has been decided to terminate machining operations at Componenta Finland Ltd 's Pietarsaari unit by the end of 2011 . Factors leading up to this decision were that the profitability of machining operations at Pietarsaari has remained weak for a long time and the strategic changes that have taken place in the customer base in the heavy trucks industry . Most of the machining work that has taken place at Pietarsaari and many of the machine tools for this work will be transferred to the Group 's unit in Främmestad in Sweden during 2011 . Componenta is strengthening the cast components supply chain by concentrating its business operations in larger , more profitable units . This decision will have an impact on personnel , and the jobs of a maximum of 60 people will be phased out at Componenta 's Pietarsaari unit during 2011 , by terminating fixed-term employment contracts and through retirement schemes and redundancies . The Pietarsaari unit currently employs about 270 people . One-time costs from the termination of machining operations are estimated at some EUR 3 million and investment and product transfer costs at EUR 1 million in 2011 . The termination of machining operations and the personnel reductions do not affect the Componenta Finland Ltd. . Pistons unit in Pietarsaari .

"After a dramatic slump in revenue in the wake of the global economic crisis , the technotrans Group 's business performance regained stability in 2010 . Revenue reached EUR 85.9 million overall , representing a rise of 4.5 % on the previous year ( EUR 82.2 million ) . Extensive measures to increase and stabilise profitability , coupled with the recovery in business , brought the company back into operating profitability . Whereas it had posted EBIT of EUR -11.9 million in the previous year , EBIT for the 2010 financial year now reached EUR 3.0 million despite further consolidation measures , this corresponds to an EBIT margin of 3.5 % . The 2010 target range for revenue and earnings was therefore achieved at the lower end . The cash flow developed positively during financial year 2010 as well . Overall , the net cash from operating activities amounted to EUR 7.4 million ( previous year EUR 3.6 million ) . The free cash flow amounted to EUR 6.3 million ( previous year EUR 2.4 million ) . Cash and cash equivalents at year-end rose by EUR 2.8 million or 27.7 % to EUR 13.1 million ( previous year EUR 10.3 million ) . A consolidated net profit of EUR 1.5 million is reported for the 2010 financial year ( previous year EUR -10.3 million ) , equivalent to earnings per outstanding share of EUR 0.24 ( previous year EUR -1.65 ) . The net profit for the financial year is netted against the accumulated loss of technotrans AG from previous years . Therefore no dividend will be distributed for 2010 . For 2011 , Management expects to see a much more dynamic development . The target is to increase revenue for the technotrans Group back up to around EUR 100 million . In addition to a gradually recover in demand from the printing industry management expects activities outside the printing industry , and more specifically the takeover of Termotek AG in 2011 and its consolidation from this year , to have a stronger impact on the growth . In addition , the company aims to increase the operating result for 2011 to between six and seven percent .

As a particularly positive aspect , the decline in rental income ( due to disposals of properties and fund placement ) was largely offset by reduced interest expenses and enhanced property management efficiency . FFO per share amounted to EUR 1.18 , primarily reflecting the increased number of shares caused by the capital increase in March 2010 ( 2009 EUR 1.47 ) . With a profit for the period of EUR 16.5 million ( up 2 per cent on the 2009 figure of EUR 16.1 million ) , the Company 's results for 2010 were above expectations . Whilst rental income was lower , the decline was more than compensated for by positive factors in this context , the most important contributors were higher profits on the disposal of properties ( EUR 5.1 million ) , lower operating expenditure , and lower financing costs . Based on the higher number of shares outstanding following the capital increase , earnings per share declined to EUR 0.44 ( 2009 EUR 0.49 ) . Given these positive results , the Company intends to raise distributions . The Management Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting to pay a dividend of EUR 0.35 per share , a 17 per cent increase over the EUR 0.30 per share paid for the 2009 financial year . Detailed review of results DIC Asset AG 's total revenues for the 2010 financial year went up strongly , to EUR 228.8 million ( 2009 EUR 171.3 million ) . The marked 34 per cent increase was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of properties , which rose from EUR 15.2 million to EUR 81.2 million . At EUR 124.9 million , gross rental income remained a reliable source of income . The 7 per cent year-on-year decline is largely in line with the sale of properties already mentioned , and also reflects the inclusion of five properties in the first DIC special fund during the fourth quarter . Despite a business environment that continued to be challenging for the letting of real estate , at 256,600 qm letting volume rose once again , by 5 per cent ( 2009 245,500 qm ) . In this context , renewals were up strongly , to around 153,400 qm ( 2009 136,700 qm ) , whilst new rental agreements covering 103,200 qm , were close to the previous year 's level of 108,800 qm . Total new rentals in 2010 were equivalent to annualised rental income of EUR 27.0 million ( 2009 EUR 24.8 million ) . At the end of 2010 , DIC Asset AG 's real estate portfolio comprised 288 properties with a rental space of 1.2 million qm and a market value of EUR 2.0 billion . The Company exploited the recovery in the market environment to successfully place 29 properties , generating aggregate proceeds of EUR 132 million on average , the prices achieved exceeded the most recent market valuations by 6 per cent . Market values , which are reviewed by independent experts each year , increased by 1.1 per cent . This recovery reflected the successful rental activity , and the start of the wider recovery of the market generally . At EUR 15.27 , net asset value ( NAV ) per share for 2010 exceeded the previous year 's figure ( 2009 EUR 13.87 after the capital increase in 2010 ) . Overall , operating costs declined significantly , to EUR 17.4 million ( 2009 EUR 18.2 million ) . At EUR 8.0 million , administrative expenses were down considerably year-on-year ( 2009 EUR 9.0 million ) . At the same time , personnel expenses of EUR 9.4 million were virtually in line with the previous year 's figure of EUR 9.2 million . Both items reflect the Company 's success in its efforts to reduce expenditure . Despite lower income , the ratio of operating expenses to gross rental income ( adjusted for real estate management income ) thus remained stable at 11 per cent . DIC Asset AG 's total assets stood at EUR 2.0 billion as at 31 December 2010 ( 2009 EUR 2.2 billion ) , reflecting the sales of properties . Financial debt stood at just under EUR 1.4 billion at the year-end 2010 , approximately EUR 200 million less than the year before . Long-term fixed interest rate agreements or hedges are in place for close to 81 per cent of financial debt , with 69 per cent having a maturity of over three years . Only 7 per cent will require refinancing during 2011 . During 2010 , DIC Asset AG renewed four portfolio financings with an aggregate volume of approximately EUR 370 million , which improved the maturity structure and lowered financing costs . Interest expenses declined to EUR 70.4 million ( 2009 EUR 74.6 million ) , reflecting loan renewals at lower interest rates and the reduction in liabilities . The average interest rate paid on all liabilities fell to 4.30 per cent , 30 basis points below the previous year ( 2009 4.60 per cent ) . The average term of liabilities is approximately four years . Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation ( EBDA ) increased to EUR 47.3 million ( 2009 EUR 46.6 million ) . Cash flow from operating activities ( after interest and taxes paid ) was down slightly year-on-year , to EUR 37.7 million ( 2009 EUR 38.7 million ) . Cash and cash equivalents of EUR 117.3 million were up strongly , exceeding the previous year-end level by EUR 78.5 million . Forecast for 2011 Backed by its stable operating performance , DIC Asset AG has embarked upon the new year with ambitious targets . DIC 's projections are based on the expectation that the recovery of the overall economy will give a continued boost to the real estate sector . The Company anticipates growth potential across all investment segments , and intends to use further attractive opportunities for acquiring real estate assets during the coming months . Stronger demand will provide the potential for new rental contracts at more attractive terms . Thanks to the sound preparations for its two major developments , the ` MainTor ' project in Frankfurt_Main , and the ` Opera Offices ' project in Hamburg , DIC Asset AG is well-positioned and sufficiently flexible to capitalize on the accelerating market dynamics , and to begin to implement the projects at short notice . DIC Asset AG aims to match the previous year 's results during the 2011 financial year . Based on the existing portfolio and together with acquisitions the Company expects rental income to amount to between EUR 112 and EUR 115 million , with operating profit ( FFO ) in a range from EUR 40 million to EUR 42 million . Capital increase to support further acquisitions Through the issue of up to 6,531,249 new shares , DIC Asset AG is to increase its share capital to up to 45,718,747 shares . The proceeds from the issue will give the Company more room to maneuver and is to be used to exploit additional opportunities for acquisitions . The new shares are to be offered for subscription to shareholders at a price of EUR 8.00 and a ratio of 6 1 . This represents an increase of up to 17 per cent in current share capital . In this process , the company is to make use of part of the authorised capital on which the Annual General Meeting passed a resolution on 5 July 2010 and intends to receive proceeds of up to approx . EUR 52.2 million from the issue . The subscription period for the new shares runs from 17 March 2011 to 30 March 2011 .

Consolidated revenues came to EUR 635.7 million and EBIT stood at EUR 36.4 million . The international share of revenues leapt from 5.8 percent in 2009 to 25.9 percent . A new record was also set for the sale of modules Based on a peak power of 313 megawatt ( MWp ) , 55 percent more solar modules were sold through the two sales channels of Components _ Systems and Power Plants than in 2009 . Unscheduled curtailment of feed-in tariffs and the early onset of winter determined demand The performance of the company , especially in the first half-year , was characterised by strong domestic demand , as the feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic electricity in Germany were subject to unscheduled curtailments on 1 July and 1 October additional to the regular reduction in remuneration . In the second half of the year , international business gained significant momentum and contributed around 44 percent to total revenues . The early and severe onset of winter already by late November in Europe caused demand to decline and revenues to fall short of expectations in the fourth quarter . Revenues grow by more than one third Total revenues climbed by 34.4 percent to EUR 635.7 million in the financial year 2010 ( 2009 EUR 473.0 million ) . Phoenix Solar AG 's international business developed exceptionally well . In the year under review , revenues from international business rose by almost 500 percent to EUR 164.5 million , up from EUR 27.6 million in 2009 , and achieved a share in total revenues of 25.9 percent . Business dominated by Components _ Systems The Components _ Systems segment , which contributed a share of 58 percent to revenues , dominated business . All in all , this segment grew by 23.2 percent , from EUR 299.0 million in 2009 to EUR 368.5 million in the financial year 2010 . The Power Plants segment developed even more positively , delivering a growth of 53.6 percent and generating total revenues of EUR 267.2 million ( 2009 EUR 174.0 million ) . It achieved a share in revenues of 42 percent . Increase in earnings Based on preliminary figures , EBIT amounted to EUR 36.4 million ( 2009 EUR 12.2 million ) . In comparison to the previous year , the earnings situation has improved significantly In the financial year 2010 , the EBIT margin ( ratio of EBIT to revenues ) climbed to 5.7 percent , up from 2.6 percent in 2009 . EBIT in the Components _ Systems segment stood at EUR 28.1 million and the EBIT margin at 7.6 percent . The Power Plants segment delivered an EBIT of EUR 8.3 million and an EBIT margin of 3.1 percent . The preliminary consolidated profit after tax almost trebled during the period under review and came to EUR 24.0 million compared with EUR 8.6 million on 31 December 2009 . Earnings per share therefore came to EUR 3.42 ( 2009 EUR 1.28 ) . As per 31 December 2010 , the equity ratio stood at 45.4 percent ( 2009 53.4 percent ) . Order situation On 1 January 2011 , the order book came to EUR 209 million ( 2009 EUR 296 million ) . Of this amount , EUR 46 million was attributable to the Components _ Systems segment and EUR 163 million to the Power Plants segment . Adjusted for work in progress , orders on hand totalled EUR 93 million ( 1 January 2010 EUR 234 million ) . Development anticipated in the year 2011 Based on the strong growth in the year 2010 , the Executive Board of Phoenix Solar AG anticipates stagnation in the global market in the current financial year . The German market was once again global leader in 2010 but is likely to have reached its maximum market volume , which leads the Executive Board of Phoenix Solar AG to assume that market volume will decline from 2011 onwards . Executive Board proposes dividend payment Based on the preliminary 2010 figures , the Executive Board has taken the decision today to propose to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders that a dividend of EUR 0.35 per share be paid for the financial year 2010 ( 2009 EUR 0.20 ) .

All new shares will be subscribed for by Mori Seiki Co. , Ltd. , Nagoya ( Japan ) , the cooperation partner of GILDEMEISTER AG , at an issue price of EUR 18.22 per new share . The price reflects a premium of about 27 % compared to today 's volume weighted average price for the GILDEMEISTER share or 20 % measured by the volume weighted average price of the last ten trading days . Net proceeds from the capital increase are expected to amount to approximately EUR 83 million .

"- Annual revenue of EUR 404 million and operating result ( EBIT ) of EUR 26.6 million well up on both previous year and original forecast for 2010 , Export revenue share increased to 59 % , Equity ratio over 50 % , financial debt further reduced , Outlook for 2011 further revenue growth to EUR 420 to 450 million , with EBIT margin of 4 to 6 % forecast . Munich , March 15 , 2011 , CENTROSOLAR Group AG was able to post new record levels of revenue and earnings in the past financial year . Revenue rose by 31 % from EUR 308.7 million in the previous year to EUR 403.4 million . The original forecast for the year of EUR 340 to 370 million was thus easily exceeded . The export revenue share was increased from 49 % to 59.4 % . The operating result before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) of EUR 26.6 million was actually almost four times the previous year 's figure ( EUR 6.9 million ) and was therefore also well above the original forecast for the year of EUR 14 to 16 million . Earnings after taxes reached EUR 15.8 million compared with the highly negative figure for the previous year of EUR -29.7 million that reflected the discontinuation of the joint venture with Qimonda . This equates to earnings per share of EUR 0.78 ( compared with EUR -1.94 in the previous year ) . CENTROSOLAR invested above all in the further expansion and modernisation of production capacities for solar module manufacturing and solar glass coating in 2010 . Despite this extensive investment activity and the growth-driven rise in net working capital , net financial debt was reduced further from EUR 44.0 million to a present EUR 39.9 million . Thanks to this improvement and the profits achieved , it was possible to increase the equity ratio substantially from 43.0 % to 51.8 % . The positive earnings performance is also reflected in the cash flow . Despite the expansion in working capital , an operating cash flow of EUR 18.4 million was posted in the past financial year . For 2011 , CENTROSOLAR expects to see a weakening of the German market compared with the previous year . There will once again be anticipatory effects in the second quarter prior to the reduction in the feed-in tariff , albeit not quite to the same extent as in 2010 . On the other hand fresh growth opportunities are arising in other European and North American markets but the scope for realizing them depends to some degree on the outcome of the ongoing debates about the structuring of the various national feed-in tariffs . All in all , the competitive environment is generally becoming more intense . Thanks to having built up a comparatively strong sales organization over a number of years , along with its flexible purchasing policy and its continuous improvement processes aimed at optimising costs , the company has long been prepared for tackling such a development in the markets . CENTROSOLAR is moreover able to set itself apart from the competition by focusing on roof systems and being able to offer patented key components such as its anti-reflective solar glass . In concluding the production agreement with TSMC , the company has opened up an additional sales channel that it will be readily able to serve following the expansion of manufacturing operations at Wismar to 350 MWp in the third quarter of 2011 , alongside meeting growing demand from the worldwide sales organization . The successful placement of a EUR 50 million bond has furthermore given the company the leeway and flexibility to seize organisational or potentially external opportunities for growth . Against this backdrop , the management is confident that CENTROSOLAR is well positioned to maintain its profitable growth trend over the years ahead . For 2011 , based on the assumption that there will be adequate continuity in the incentives available in Europe , the company expects to see further revenue growth to approx . EUR 420 to 450 million , with an operating margin ( EBIT ) of approx . 4 to 6 % . Assuming that the general framework for financial incentives for photovoltaic roof systems in Europe and North America continues to be adjusted in line with the general potential for cost reductions , the company considers that its strategy means it is well equipped to maintain profitable growth in 2012 and beyond .",1.052634,0.736617,True,True

Sales were increased by 49.2 % to 184.7 million Euro in 2010 . Compared to the previous year , the gross profit more than doubled to 83.8 million Euro . Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) reached an amount of 23.1 million Euro or an EBIT margin of 12.5 % of sales in the year 2010 . The net income amounted to 17.8 million Euro , equivalent to basic earnings per share ( EPS ) of 0.92 Euro . Supervisory Board and Management Board propose to the Annual General Meeting of May 17 , 2011 to pay a dividend of 0.20 Euro . The adjusted free cash flow of 20.6 million Euro also turned out satisfactory in its strength , the result of a significantly improved operating performance combined with adequate capital expenditures . The cash flow from operating activities was more than tripled in comparison with 2009 and amounted to 30.0 million Euro in 2010 ( 2009 9.4 million Euro ) . In 2010 12.4 million Euro or 6.7 % of sales were invested ( 2009 7.4 million Euro or 6.0 % of sales ) . The consequences of the recent disastrous developments in Japan are currently not foreseeable and not reflected in the following forecast . However , for ELMOS there are only marginal direct dependencies with respect to supply and customer relationships with Japan , indirect effects are currently not assessable . At a stable economy , ELMOS expects sales between 190 and 200 million Euro for 2011 . This equals a growth rate between 6 % and 12 % , based on 2010 sales of 178.6 million Euro , adjusted by the sale of the special packaging business .

"- Positive business trend leads to increased volume of 11.9 % , Net revenue increase of 8.6 % , 16.3 % in terms of local currencies , Operating profit of CHF 8.4 million burdened by raw material prices and currency effects , Distribution of CHF 5.00 _ share proposed , Cautiously optimistic outlook for 2011 In 2010 the Cham Paper Group achieved a net revenue of CHF 339.5 million . This corresponds to an increase of ca . 8.6 % as compared to 2009 , or 16.3 % in terms of local currencies . The volume sold of 204,126 tonnes of specialty papers was 11.9 % above the 2009 figure , and 9.0 % above the figure for 2008 . Consequently , not only has the stabilization of market demand continued , the Cham Paper Group has also successfully returned to a growth path after the brief , yet sharp , decline in demand at the beginning of 2009 . As already in 2009 , the Consumer Goods segment ( 47 % of the Group 's revenue ) exhibited an extremely favorable showing , particularly with regard to the flexible packaging product group , which achieved an additional growth of 8.5 % . The net revenue increase of 11.4 % in the company 's second largest segment , Industrial Release , ( 45 % of Group revenue ) reflected the economic recovery in the industry . The as-yet small Digital Imaging segment ( 8 % ) exhibited a strong performance , thanks to now-established innovative products like the Transjet paper . Unfortunately the Cham Paper Group 's successful positioning in the marketplace and the brisk demand for its products are not reflected in its profitability . In the favorable market environment of last year the company was forced to absorb skyrocketing raw material costs , our Swiss mill was unexpectedly confronted with a sudden sharp decline in the value of the euro , the currency of its key export markets . Whereas the Italian mills again operated more profitably as compared to 2009 , the margins at the traditionally profitable Swiss plant shrank substantially . The Group 's operating profit of CHF 8.4 million for the year ( 2009 CHF 13.6 million ) is nevertheless disappointing despite the Group 's strong market performance . In the last analysis , the Group 's net profit for 2010 slipped as the result of non-recurring items ( reversal of capitalized tax loss carryovers ) to minus CHF 1.8 million . The operating profit was negatively impacted by forex effects of almost CHF 10 million , the financial result being worsened by an additional CHF 4.2 million . Strategic planning at two levels The Board of Directors and the Executive Management Board were forced to deal simultaneously with two central issues planning to satisfy rising demand in the medium term and initiating quick-acting measures to preserve the profitability of production in Switzerland , particularly in Cham 's primary market Europe ( 80 % of sales revenue ) . The Board of Directors has been intensively engaged in the Group 's strategic medium-term planning since 2009 . Based on the Group 's strong position in the specialty papers market and the successful development and market launch of innovative products in the next few years to come , the Executive Management Board and the Board of Directors are reckoning with an increase in the volume sold that will exceed today 's capacities . The Group is currently in a position to produce identical ` Cham Paper quality ' at all locations , and this enables flexible planning . This development is the result of standardized processes , quality management improvements and the standards introduced over the past three years . At the same time a growing requirement for specialty papers with attractive growth rates has arisen in Asia that can not be satisfied from Europe in the medium term , and necessitates local production capacities . Expansion of Cham 's own capacity in Italy and production alliances in Europe In the course of strategic production planning , the three existing mills in Switzerland and Italy were subjected to in-depth analysis to gauge their future optimization and expansion capability . In addition , an investment project for China was fully developed subsequent to in-depth market and site investigations . In a policy decision the Board of Directors spoke out in favor of gradually increasing the production capacity in Condino and engaging in the project planning of a strategic expansion of the Carmignano mill or , in the alternative , examining strategic production alliances in the northern eurozone . The positioning and further development of the Cham site is also being examined in detail . In the second half of this year the Board of Directors plans to present a detailed strategy for the optimal utilization of the Group 's market opportunities in the specialty papers market during the coming decade . Focus on maintaining profitability in Europe The forex effects during the year under review underscores the timeliness of these strategic projects . The sizable strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro had a negative impact on the profitability of production in Switzerland . Almost 100 % of the products manufactured by the Cham mill are exported , the euro area accounting for the company 's largest market . Raw material prices , which increased by approximately one third during 2010 , were passed on in a delayed manner by way of price increases of just under 10 % . Unfortunately offsetting exchange losses in a similar manner was not possible . Whereas the Italian mills proved successful in maintaining their EBIT margin in the lower part of the 5%-12 % target range , this was not possible at the Swiss production site . Although sales prices continue to be upwardly adjusted and the sales team is able to prevail with this pricing to a certain extent , particularly with regard to passing on increased raw material costs - , at the end of 2010 the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Board decided that strategic objectives would be prioritized . In so doing , the focus in the short term is on boosting profitability and achieving margin targets in the primary markets of Europe , with global growth being a secondary objective . The expansion into China is to take place in two steps . In order to better capitalize on the market opportunities offered there , the Group will continue to optimize its supply chain into Asia so as to be able to more quickly serve customers locally . Should the current market success prove sustainable in the next few years to come , the fully developed plant project will be reactivated . Optimization efforts to come to fruition in 2011 In 2011 the Group 's earnings will benefit from the price increases gradually going into effect in parallel with stabilizing raw material costs . On the cost side the results of the optimization projects in purchasing and procurement will also take effect , these projects having been identified in concert with a specialist consulting partner and implemented step by step throughout the year under review . Among other things , this extends to pooling purchases of pulp and chemicals with other paper manufacturers . In addition , further components of the procurement volume in Switzerland such as the sourcing of energy and services were switched from CHF to EUR in order to counter the currency problem . Balance sheet remains stable The Cham Paper Group continues to have a sound balance sheet . Thanks to the strict discipline exercised in payables and receivables management , the Group 's net working capital dropped to only CHF 83.5 million ( 2009 CHF 90.4 million ) despite the substantial increase in volume , the drop being due not least to exchange rate effects . At year end cash and cash equivalents amounted to CHF 61.8 million , with the Group 's net debt amounting to CHF 19.4 million and the gearing ratio a modest 9.8 % ( 2009 13 % ) . During the year under review , the equity ratio increased from 55.3 % to 57.6 % . Tax-favorable capital repayment of CHF 5.00 per share proposed The operating result achieved by the Cham Paper Group during 2010 does not permit an ordinary dividend to be disbursed under the dividend policy established in 2009 . In view of the Group 's sound financial situation , its high amounts of cash on hand and its intact business prospects , the Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting of shareholders approve a special distribution in the form of a tax-favorable capital repayment of CHF 5.00 per share . Outlook for 2011 We are reckoning with a continued positive development of demand for our products . Our sales efforts are paying off and our product innovations are meeting with a positive response in the marketplace . Based on a budgeted euro exchange rate of CHF 1.30 , we expect a renewed increase in sales volume in the mid-single-digit range and an improvement in profitability .

"In 2010 , sales increases by 34 % to EUR 31.2 million , EBITDA was around EUR 2.9 million ( 2009 EUR 3 . million ) , EBIT was around minus EUR 1.5 million ( 2009 minus EUR 0.5 million ) Passau , March 18 , 2011 , In Q4 2010 InTiCa Systems ' earnings were still held back by high unit costs . The principal reasons for this were rising raw material costs , which could not be passed on to customers immediately , combined with an unfavourable sales split across the product portfolio and exceptionally high transport costs to meet delivery obligations . Overall , in fiscal year 2010 , the unit cost increase was approximately EUR 2,0 million above budget . Much of the cost increases mentioned above had a negative effect on the business mainly in the second half of 2010 . The rise in production staff , which is geared to achieving the 2011 sales target , increased personnel expenses by around EUR 0.2 million in Q4 2010 . Earnings in 2010 were also adversely impacted by write-downs of EUR 0.3 million as a result of the business trend in Q4 and the preparation of the annual financial statements for the fiscal year . InTiCa Systems therefore expects to report sales growth of 34 % to EUR 31.2 million in fiscal 2010 ( 2009 EUR 23.3 million ) , with EBITDA of around EUR 2.9 million ( 2009 EUR 3,0 million ) and EBIT of around minus EUR 1.5 million ( 2009 minus EUR 0.5 million ) .

"By court order of 18 March 2011 , of which WestLB has become aware today , the General Court of the European Union has rejected the application of the Sparkassenverband Westfalen-Lippe to suspend the operation of a EU condition to discontinue the writing of new business by Westdeutsche ImmobilienBank AG ( ` WestImmo ' ) . WestImmo is a 100 % subsidiary of WestLB . The condition referred to above is part of a decision of the European Commission dated 12 Mai 2009 approving state aid granted to WestLB . It concerns the discontinuation of writing new business and the gradual run-down of the existing business of WestImmo after the deadline for the sale of WestImmo has expired . The European Commission had extended that deadline until 15 February 2011 . However , by order of 31 January 2011 , i.e. prior to the expiry of the deadline on 15 February 2011 the General Court of the European Union had suspended the operation of the aforesaid condition . By virtue of the order now issued on 18 March 2011 , the suspension order of 31 January 2011 has been canceled . This also ends the suspension of the deadline and of the operation of the aforesaid condition . Outside of the court proceedings described above , the Federal Republic of Germany applied on 28 October 2010 with the European Commission to extend the deadline for the sale or , as the case may be , the discontinuation of writing new business of WestImmo for an adequate period of time . On 30 January 2011 , the Federal Republic of Germany applied with the European Commission to extend the deadline for the sale or , as the case may be , the discontinuation of writing new business of WestImmo to 31 July 2011 . The European Commission has not yet decided hereon . In reaction to the aforesaid order of the General Court of the European Union of 18 March 2011 , the management board of WestLB will continue to take all measures within its powers to work towards a positive decision of the European Commission on extending the deadline , and , at the same time , procure , as a precaution , those resolutions of the bodies of WestLB and WestImmo that are necessary to ensure the satisfaction of the aforesaid EU condition . In this context , the management board of WestLB will continue the sales process for WestImmo . In its ad hoc publication of 1 March 2011 , WestLB has given notice that WestLB AG posted a break-even result of EUR 0 million under German GAAP for its 2010 financial year . This already includes a write-down in respect of the book value of the interest held by WestLB in WestImmo .

"Proposal at the upcoming AGM to appropriate profit and restructure Wacker Neuson SE as a holding company ( Munich , March 21 , 2011 ) Parent company Wacker Neuson SE reports retained earnings in the amount of EUR 13.1 million for fiscal 2010 , of which EUR 0.17 is to be paid in dividends per eligible share . Plans to structure Wacker Neuson SE as a holding company will align the company 's legal organization more closely with the operating management setup . * Dividend proposal During today 's Supervisory Board meeting , the Supervisory Board of Wacker Neuson SE approved the Executive Board 's proposed dividend payment of EUR 0.17 per share for fiscal 2010 , which it will propose to the AGM on May 26 , 2011 . In total therefore , the company will be paying out EUR 11.9 million . During the past fiscal year , the net profit generated by the parent company Wacker Neuson SE amounted to EUR 1.9 million ( previous year EUR 3.6 million ) . Retained earnings thus amounted to EUR 13.1 million ( previous year EUR 3.6 million ) . Based on net Group profit of EUR 23.9 million ( previous year EUR -110.1 million ) , the distribution ratio for the proposed dividend pans out at around 50 percent . This is higher than the target ratio set by the company as part of its long-term dividend policy . As no dividends were paid out last year , management regards this year 's payout as justified . * Proposed restructuring as a holding company During its meeting today , the Supervisory Board also approved the Executive Board 's proposal to structure Wacker Neuson SE as a holding company and to put this resolution to the AGM . As part of the restructuring , Production Germany , Sales Germany and Sales Europe will be separated from Wacker Neuson SE in their entirety and established as separate legal entities . Central Group and corporate functions will remain at Wacker Neuson SE under the umbrella of what is now central administration . The three operating segments will be divested into three German companies registered in Munich and structured as GmbH and Co. . KG limited partnerships . Under the proposed holding structure , Wacker Neuson SE shall hold 100 percent of the capital in the three new affiliates . The American subsidiary , Wacker Neuson Corporation , transitioned from a parent company to a holding structure on January 1 , 2011 and now manages production , logistics and sales within the framework of separate legal entities . These measures shall not result in any changes for shareholders in the company as Wacker Neuson SE will remain the sole owner of the new operating companies . In financial terms , the new legal structure does not affect the Group 's net assets and earnings position .

Consolidated group revenue in 2010 totalled EUR 31.5 million . This represented a growth of approx . 12 % compared to the previous year 's revenue of EUR 28.1 million . Gross profits amounted to EUR 20.1 million after EUR 18.6 million in 2009 . The gross margin fell to 63.8 % , compared to 66.1 % in the previous year .

"Munich Re provisionally estimates that its claims payments for the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan will total some EUR1 .5 bn ( after retrocession and before tax ) . As a result , its profit target of around EUR2 .4 bn for the financial year 2011 can no longer be maintained . This initial loss estimate is based solely on modelling . Owing to the extent of the destruction , further possible aftershocks and difficult clearing-up operations , it will be many weeks before the losses are assessed and all the claims notifications from Japanese primary insurers have come in . As many reinsurance covers do not attach until very high losses have been sustained by individual cedants , it will only become apparent at a later stage whether and to what extent reinsurers are affected by losses under particular treaties . Further uncertainties result from the impact on international flows of goods and supply chains from business interruptions suffered by Japanese industrial producers . For Munich Re , the first quarter of 2011 had already been marked by high losses from the earthquake in New Zealand , the floods in Brisbane and Cyclone Yasi in Australia . Now including the projected losses from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan , the major-loss burden from natural catastrophes amounts to over EUR2 .5 bn ( after retrocession and before tax ) , thus far exceeding the volume to be expected for this period . That means the profit target for 2011 of around EUR2 .4 bn is no longer achievable .",-2.082386,-1.446141,False,False

The plan also includes closing down the pellet mill . ` Despite several years of focused efforts to turn around the losses of Kopparfors Sawmill , we have been unable to achieve the improvements needed in efficiency and profitability . The slowness of the recovery in markets combined with poor operational efficiency , high raw material costs , unfavourable exchange rates and lack of cost flexibility have kept Kopparfors loss-making . In our analysis , even in the most optimistic scenario , we can see potential for only marginal improvement , ' says Hannu Kasurinen , EVP , Stora Enso Wood Products . ` This is of course a difficult message for our employees in Kopparfors . The closure would affect not only the people who work at Kopparfors Sawmill and the pellet mill , but also many people in the community . We will do everything we can in close co-operation with the local community and authorities to help every employee affected by the plans to find re-employment options . ` We are investigating alternatives for supplying our key customers and plan to utilise some of the sawmill and pellet mill machinery at other Stora Enso locations . The planned mill closure would not affect wood purchasing in Sweden . ' The Group will record a one-time non-cash fixed asset and working capital write-down of approximately EUR 20 million and in addition a restructuring provision with a cash impact of approximately EUR 9 million as non-recurring items in its first quarter 2011 operating profit . Based on 2010 annual figures the closure would reduce Stora Enso 's annual sales by approximately EUR 65 million but have no material impact on the Group 's annual operating profit . The planned closure will have a positive tax impact of approximately EUR 8 million in the first quarter of 2011 . Kopparfors Sawmill has an annual production capacity of 310 000 m3 of sawnwood , of which 150 000 m3 can be further processed by planing . The pellet mill has an annual capacity of 160 000 tonnes .

During the year , CHF 40 million was spent on the investment and cost-reduction program launched in 2009 . One-off losses resulting from the flight disruptions caused by the volcanic ash cloud in the first half 2010 came to CHF 14.5 million . Outlook for 2011 ` Political turmoil , particularly in the North African tourist destinations of Egypt and Tunisia , led to a temporary suspension of all holidays to these countries in February 2011 . Cancellations were only partially offset by rebookings , so booking volumes are down . However , our flexible business model allows us to adjust our offerings to other holiday regions . The sharp depreciation of the euro against the Swiss franc is also hurting bookings figures , ' said Peter Rothwell , CEO of the Kuoni Group . Group-wide booking levels for the tour operating business in Swiss franc terms were as of 13 March 2011 7 % below their prior-year equivalents , but in local currency terms on prior-year level . ` Due to the slight weakening of economic growth in the main markets , the uncertain geopolitical situation in Arabic countries and the potential consequences of the severe earthquake in Japan , it is difficult to estimate what will happen in 2011 , ' Peter Rothwell added .

"elexis AG _ Ad hoc disclosure according to Section 15 of the WpHG on the final results for the financial year 2010 * elexis has confirmed an increase in its operation result before depreciation of goodwill of 10.6 million Euro * EBIT after depreciation of HEKUMA 's goodwill was 4.0 million Euro * Provisional Group net income after deduction of minority interests increased to 2.2 million Euro ( 6.8 million Euro before impairment ) essentially because of changes to the financial result * Dividend proposal Payment of 50 percent of the Group 's net income after minority interests , but before adjustment to goodwill to counterbalance the negative effects of the High Precision Automation division * Outlook International market presence as the basis for profitable growth Wenden , 23 March 2011 , elexis AG , a company listed on the Frankfurt stock market 's SDAX , today confirms its provisional results for fiscal year 2010 . elexis Group is an international company operating in global markets . Having its own sites in Europe , Asia , North America and Latin America plays an important role in that international presence . Additionally , the company benefits from a balanced product portfolio that focuses industrial production processes . Its activities concentrate on the markets ` health ' , ` mobility ' , ` environment and energy ' and ` new consumer and packaging patterns ' . Technological and market leadership were and remain the engines of profitable growth at the company . Order intake and sales elexis Group 's order intake increased by 26 percent over the reporting period , reaching 150.7 million Euro ( previous year 119.2 million Euro ) . Sales also increased after a short delay , growing by 8 percent from 127.0 million Euro ( previous year ) to 136.7 million Euro at 31 December 2010 . Over the last fiscal year , the company 's export quota reached 58.2 percent compared to 50.9 percent in the previous year . These results bear witness to the Group 's significant international presence . The BRIC nations in particular were drivers of economic growth . Growth in the divisions The High Precision Automation division has not been able to benefit from the growth perspectives in developing countries . One of the pivotal reasons for this has been its client structure , which focuses on industrialised nations , where demand has emphasised replacement investment . Nevertheless , order intake increased at 31 December 2010 from 13.7 million Euro in the previous year to 24.8 million Euro , thus almost doubling . In fiscal year 2010 , the High Precision Automation division generated revenues of 18.7 million Euro compared to 13.4 million Euro in the previous year . This level of sales , however , is below the break-even threshold . After an operating lost ( earnings before interest and tax ) of minus 4.0 million Euro in fiscal year 2009 , at 31 December 2010 , before adjusting goodwill , a negative EBIT of minus 3.2 million Euro was recorded . After depreciation of goodwill the EBIT stood at minus 9.8 million Euro . The High Quality Automation division compensates for the operating losses of the High Precision Automation division . Order intake increased by 19 percent , standing at 125.9 million Euro at 31 December 2010 ( previous year 105.5 million Euro ) . The divisions revenues increased from 113.6 million Euro to 118.0 million Euro during the reporting period . Earnings before interest and tax ( EBIT ) increased to 16 million Euro ( previous year 11.0 million Euro ) . This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 13.5 percent . This margin was 9.7 percent last year . Earnings position elexis Group 's earnings position was affected by a depreciation of the goodwill of HEKUMA GmbH for a total of 6.6 million Euro . Before depreciation , elexis Group 's earnings position was as follows The operating result ( EBIT ) almost doubled to 10.6 million Euro ( previous year 5.4 million Euro ) . The Group EBIT margin stood at 7.7 percent , having been 4.2 percent the previous year . Earnings before tax ( EBT ) increased from 4.5 million Euro the previous year to 9.6 million Euro . Group net income after minority interests was 6.8 million Euro at 31 December 2010 compared to 1.7 million Euro the previous year . After adjusting goodwill , the Group 's earnings were as follows operating result before interest and tax stood at 4.0 million Euro at the end of the reporting period ( previous year 5.4 million Euro ) , representing 2.9 percent . Earnings before tax ( EBT ) fell from 4.5 million Euro the previous year to 3.0 million Euro over fiscal year 2010 . After minority interests , the Group 's net income reached 2.2 million Euro , surpassing the 1.7 million Euro recorded the previous year . elexis Group profits per share at the end of the reporting period were 0.24 Euro compared to 0.19 Euro in 2009 . Capital and other key figures After subtracting minority interests , the Group 's results remained solid . After depreciation of goodwill the company recorded 69.1 million Euro of capital in fiscal year 2010 ( previous year 66.9 million Euro ) . Despite depreciation the company 's capital ratio increased from 51.6 percent in 2009 to 52.2 percent at 31 December 2010 . Extended net liquidity significantly exceeded the previous year 's figure , increasing from 12.6 million Euro to 19.4 million Euro . Cash flow also almost recovered to the level seen before the recession . Operating cash flow improved at 31 December 2010 to 14.4 million Euro compared to 5.8 million Euro the previous year . Dividend proposal The Group 's net income figure ( after deduction of minority interests ) used to calculate dividend payments was negatively affected last fiscal year . On the one hand , the turn around at HEKUMA GmbH has been delayed by at least six months and , on the other hand , the result for the period allocable was reduced because of the adjustment to goodwill . Thus , the Management Board and the Supervisory Board recommend a dividend payment that balances out the negative effects that impacted the 2010 fiscal year . A proposal will be made to the AGM in May 2011 to pay a dividend of 50 percent of the Group net result ( after deduction of minority interests ) but before the adjustment to goodwill . This corresponds to a payment of 3.4 million Euro or 0.37 Euro per share . The divided yield would , therefore , be 2.8 percent of the close of year price . Outlook A return to worldwide growth as 2011 market leader As forecasted , elexis Group clearly increased its sales and income over fiscal year 2010 and laid the foundations for sustainable success in the future . The Group has had an international presence for many years now . Given that fact , current shifts in emphasis of demand do not represent a new challenge for the companies in elexis Group . Rather , they can rely on their product competences and innovative force and offer appropriate products in countries where structural changes are occurring and demand increasing . Industrial production and its automation is a major trend that will continue over the long term . elexis Group 's position in Asia will be further strengthened with the construction of a new Busienss Center in Shanghai . From the current point of view the Management Bord of elexis AG expects profitable growth in defined target markets and an EBIT margin of more than 10 % for fiscal year 2011 . Thanks to elexis Group 's technological leadership , international profile and its diversification in a range of sectors , the Management Board anticipates an increase in new orders and sales over the course of this year . Further growth in new orders and sales is also expected in 2012 .

The appropriateness of this strategy deployed by DEAG is demon-strated by the excellent results in 2010 in line with those achieved in 2009 . The DEAG Executive Board anticipates a continuation of the positive business development in 2011 . Dur-ing the current year all earnings ratios are to be improved further . The focus will be on the ongoing stra-tegic stepping up of the high-margin business , with special emphasis on the European expansion and the ongoing integration of the 360 degree model . With concerts and tours , for instance by Peter Maffay , Amy Winehouse , Bon Jovi , Jean Michel Jarre , Justin Bieber , Rush or Sting in the Rock_Pop segment and Classical Music tours with Anna Netrebko , David Garrett and major productions such as ` Romeo and Juliet ' in The O2 arena in London , DEAG is in an excellent position for 2011 . The final numbers and the Annual Report 2010 will be published on March 31 , 2011 and will be posted on www.deag.de in the Investor Relations section during the day .",6.678699,6.262121,True,True

"FINNAIR PLC STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE 24 March 2011 AT 15.20 Finnair CEO Mika Vehviläinen at the company AGM . ` World events in recent times can not but have an effect on Finnair . We expect that the shocking and devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan will have a negative impact on flight demand in the coming weeks and months , ' says Finnair CEO Mika Vehviläinen in his speech at today 's Annual General Meeting at the Helsinki Fair Centre . ` It is currently impossible to assess , however , the future course of the crisis in Japan and the subsequent recovery . Over the longer term , the reconstruction of Japan may act as a stimulus for our sector . We will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation and its effects . At the moment , however , we are focusing on helping Japan by flying our scheduled nearly 20 flights per week to Japanese destinations and by delivering humanitarian aid to the disaster area . This is the best way that we can help the Japanese people at this sad time , ' says Vehviläinen . According to Vehviläinen , in addition to the situation in Japan , the sharp increase in the price of oil due to events in the Middle East and North Africa will inevitably affect Finnair 's result in 2011 . ` To date we have not seen any stabilisation or decline in oil prices . It is impossible to predict how the situation will change both in Japan and the Middle East or how fuel costs will develop in future . Our current estimate , however , is that we will be unable to achieve a positive result unless there is a substantial improvement towards the end of the year in the oil price trend and in the situation in Japan . Our first quarter result , moreover , will be even weaker than previously forecast . Finnair will , of course , continue all measures aimed at restoring operational profitability and will also explore new means of achieving this goal , ' says Vehviläinen .

On that basis , the existing credit lines , partly secured by government guarantees and maturing in July 2012 , will be refinanced early with the net proceeds and through entering into a new revolving credit facility of EUR 500 million subject to improved terms and conditions and with a maturity until the end of 2014 . With the planned issue of a high yield bond with a medium-term maturity , Heidelberg seeks to take advantage of favorable capital market environment to repay existing loans and for general corporate funding purposes . The placement of the high yield bond will be assisted by a banking consortium lead by five joint bookrunners . The high yield bond offering is to be led by this consortium starting from March 28 , 2011 . The high yield bond is scheduled for issue in the week of April 4 , 2011 . Afterwards the bond will be listed in the unregulated market of the Luxembourg Securities Exchange . Following a successful placement of the high yield bond , the past credit financing partly col-lateralized by government guarantees is to be replaced by a new revolving credit facility for EUR 500 million with a banking consortium .

This will therefore enable the company to finance its own operations again , without any government support , more than a year before the government guarantees were scheduled to expire .

"Brilon , March 29 , 2011 , CENTROTEC Sustainable AG ended the 2010 financial year with the highest revenue ( EUR 479.7 million ) and the best earnings figures ( EUR 36.2 million EBIT ) in the history of the group . Earnings in particular rose overproportionally at all levels and were well up on both the previous year and the previous record-best figures from 2008 . These results , achieved in a market environment that remained difficult , meant that the forecasts upgraded on multiple occasions during the year were comprehensively met . This profitable growth was achieved in particular thanks to the even stronger market position for the CENTROTEC companies in the Climate Systems segment in 2010 . As well as the further improvement in its position in the German heating market , there was substantial growth in export business particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe . Based on the renewed rise in earnings and the further substantial reduction in net borrowings ( EUR 71.1 million , previous year EUR 86.5 million ) , the group is planning to distribute its first ever dividend of EUR 0.10 . 2010 accounts CENTROTEC posted consolidated revenue of EUR 479.7 million in the 2010 financial year ( previous year EUR 466.6 million ) , representing organic revenue growth of 2.8 % . Consolidated revenue was therefore likewise up on the previous record revenue total from 2008 . There were substantial increases in revenue in the largest segment Climate Systems and also in the Medical Technology and Engineering Plastics segment . On the other hand the Gas Flue Systems segment was not quite able to match the previous year 's revenue figure , which had marked a new record thanks to non-recurring effects . In the core segment Climate Systems , revenue of EUR 331.8 million was 7.2 % up on the prior-year figure of EUR 309.5 million and equally bettered the previous record from 2008 . As already forecast during the year the second core segment Gas Flue Systems , which had grown particularly strongly , was not quite able to match those figures in the second half and its revenue was down 11.9 % on the previous year 's record level at EUR 112.8 million ( EUR 128.1 million ) . 2010 saw the smallest segment , Medical Technology and Engineering Plastics , recover well from the previous year 's cyclically induced slump with revenue growing by 20.9 % to EUR 35.0 million . At group level the forecast for 2010 made at the start of the year proved accurate , with revenue coming in at EUR 480 million . The earnings forecast for 2010 was upgraded on two occasions in the course of the year following the positive performance of business operations and the investment result . With EBIT climbing to EUR 36.2 million ( previous year EUR 29.0 million ) , the most recent bandwidth forecast of EUR 36 to 37 million was achieved in full . Earnings before tax of EUR 34.5 million ( previous year EUR 12.7 million ) were likewise increased substantially , among other things thanks to a substantial improvement in the investment result of EUR +4.4 million ( previous year EUR -9.8 million ) , mainly from the 26.2 % investment in the listed company CENTROSOLAR , and produced earnings after tax of EUR 25.6 million ( previous year EUR 5.2 million ) . On that basis , EPS of EUR 1.54 ( previous year EUR 0.33 , previous year adjusted EUR 0.93 ) was clearly within the bandwidth of EUR 1.50 to 1.60 that had been upgraded during the year . 2011 forecast by segment In view of the fundamentally positive general situation and the group companies ' good position , CENTROTEC expects revenue to grow to EUR 520 to 535 million for the 2011 financial year , with the operating result ( EBIT ) increasing to EUR 40 to 42 million . Earnings per share ( EPS ) of EUR 1.70 to 1.80 are forecast for 2011 . In a departure from previous years , the Supervisory Board and Management Board of CENTROTEC Sustainable AG will propose to the Shareholders ' Meeting that , as an initial step , a dividend of EUR 0.10 per dividend-bearing no par value share be distributed for the 2010 financial year . They nevertheless still plan to plough back the greater part of profit and invest it in the further organic and external growth of the company . This approach will however continue to be reviewed on a regular basis in the future and a separate decision taken each year , though at least a basic dividend is likely to be paid . CENTROTEC equally expects the organic revenue and earnings growth that is taking shape for 2011 to continue in subsequent years . CENTROTEC fundamentally sets itself the long-term target of approximately 10 % annual organic revenue growth at group level , coupled with an EBIT margin exhibiting an upward tendency in the high single figures . Revenue of EUR 350 to 360 million is planned for the Climate Systems segment for 2011 . The operating result is expected to rise in proportion to revenue because of higher materials prices and the likelihood of increased personnel expenses . The medium-term target for organic revenue growth remains 8 to 10 % , with a target EBIT margin of 8 to 9 % . In the Gas Flue Systems segment , revenue is expected to reach EUR 135 to 140 million , coupled with an increased operating result . In the medium term , average organic revenue growth is expected to be around 10 to 12 % with double-digit EBIT margins . The aim for 2011 for the Medical Technology and Engineering Plastics segment is organic revenue growth to EUR 35 to 37 million and a substantial increase in the EBIT margin . An EBIT margin in high single figures or low double figures , coupled with average annual revenue growth of 10 % , are the medium-term objectives . CENTROTEC Sustainable AG CENTROTEC Sustainable AG and its subsidiaries enjoy a presence in over 50 different countries . The principal group companies are Wolf Heiztechnik , Brink Climate Systems and Ned Air in the Climate Systems segment , which have specialised in heating , climate control and ventilation technology e.g. in the form of solar thermal systems , heat pumps , CHP units , climate control and ventilation systems with heat recovery for residential and commercial buildings , as well as Ubbink and Centrotherm , which have focused on plastic gas flue and air ducting systems and solar system components in the Gas Flue Systems segment . CENTROTEC is consequently Europe 's only listed full-service provider of solar thermal systems and energy-saving solutions for buildings .

"NEO INDUSTRIAL PLC STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE 30 March , 2011 at 12.30 pm AVILON SHUTS DOWN TEMPORARILY , REACHES MAXIMUM CAPACITY IN AUGUST Avilon Ltd , part of Neo Industrial 's Viscose Fibers business , has decided to temporarily shut down production in its Valkeakoski-based factory in April . The shutdown is due to availability problems of dissolving pulp , the main raw material for viscose fiber . As the price of cotton stays high , the global demand of both viscose and dissolving pulp has exceeded supply . Hence , Avilon has not been able to ensure the continuous availability of the raw material in order to maintain profitable production volume . During the shutdown , Avilon will complete ongoing negotiations concerning a long-term solution for its raw material needs , together with selected suppliers . According to Avilon 's estimates , the new arrangements of its pulp management enable restarting the factory 's main production line in July at the latest . The company has also made a decision on the ramp-up of a second production line , based on the prospects of the raw material undertaking , as well as the very good and continuously growing demand for viscose fiber . Avilon estimates that it will start the Valkeakoski factory 's second line in August , after which the factory will be in full production capacity . The factory was successfully started in January , and it has delivered some 4,200 tonnes of high-quality viscose fiber in the first quarter of 2011 .

"IMMOFINANZ AG results for the first three quarters of 2010_11 ( 1 May 2010 to 31 January 2011 ) * Revenues EUR 558.6 million ( 2009_10 EUR 536.8 million ) * EBITDA EUR 292.6 million ( 2009_10 EUR 306.1 million ) * EBIT EUR 343.3 million ( 2009_10 EUR 246.7 million ) * EBT EUR 251.4 million ( 2009_10 EUR 265.8 million ) * Net profit for the period EUR 229.3 million ( 2009_10 EUR 221.1 million ) * Cash flow from net profit EUR 303.2 million ( 2009_10 EUR 252.9 million ) * Book value per share EUR 5.01 ( 2009_10 EUR 4.63 ) * NAV per share ( diluted ) EUR 5.13 ( 2009_10 EUR 4.78 ) * Earnings per share ( diluted ) EUR 0.23 ( 2009_10 EUR 0.20 ) The IMMOFINANZ Group confirmed the successful turnaround and the upward trend of the first and second quarters with an increase in earnings during the third quarter of 2010_11 . The continuous optimisation of the portfolio and costs as well as an increased focus on cash flow generation should support a further improvement in operating results during the coming quarters . Income from asset management Rental income amounted to EUR 423.1 million for the first three quarters of 2010_11 , for a plus of 5.6 % over the comparable prior year period ( EUR 400.8 million ) . This growth was supported above all by the third quarter , which brought a substantial increase of 6.8 % or EUR 9.3 million in rental income . In comparison with the second quarter of 2010_11 , the increase amounted to 5.5 % or EUR 7.6 million . Rental income increased year-on-year in the retail ( +24.0 % ) , residential ( +2.7 % ) and logistics ( +8.6 % ) segments , but declined in the office segment ( -9.4 % ) . This decrease resulted from the sale of properties and the start of construction on the previously rented Gerling Quarter in Cologne . Revenues rose by 4.1 % from EUR 536.8 million to EUR 558.6 million for the first three quarters of 2010_11 . The increase of EUR 38.9 million or 55.3 % in real estate expenses reflected higher maintenance and renovation activities that are intended to improve the marketability of properties , above all in Austria . Income from asset management therefore fell slightly to EUR 333.5 million ( 2009_10 EUR 347.4 million ) . Income from property sales The sale of properties generated income of EU R 19.4 million in the first nine months of 2010_11 ( prior year EUR 35.4 million ) . These transactions focused primarily on residential properties in Austria . Income from property development The sale of inventories generated proceeds of EUR 56.0 million and income of EUR 10.6 million during the reporting period . Proceeds from the sale of apartments more than tripled over the prior year level ( EUR 16.0 million ) . The proceeds from the sale of these inventories were recorded above all in Austria ( EUR 45.4 million ) and Poland ( EUR 6.4 million ) . Other operating income Approximately one-half of the other operating income of EUR 36.7 million recorded in the third quarter is attributable to the waiver of a receivable by a financial institution . This receivable was related to a property that was taken over in connection with the agreements with Constantia Packaging B.V. EBITDA , EBIT , EBT , net profit for the period and cash flow Results of operations ( EBITDA ) clearly exceeded the comparable prior year level at EUR 111.2 million for the third quarter of 2010_11 . However , EBITDA was still slightly lower in year-on-year comparison with a 4.4 % decline from EU R 306.1 million to EU R 292.6 million . This decline resulted primarily from the increase in real estate expenses . Positive valuation results of EUR 50.7 million ( 2009_10 EUR -59.4 million ) led to a 39.2 % improvement in EBIT , which rose from EUR 246.7 million to EUR 343.3 million . Financial results declined from EUR 19.1 million to EUR -91.9 million , solely due to non-cash accounting effects from foreign exchange fluctuations ( EUR -48.4 million versus EUR 92.7 million in 2009_10 ) that were only offset in part by the positive valuation of financial instruments ( EUR 30.0 million versus EUR -46.9 million in 2009_10 ) . Earnings before tax ( EBT ) were therefore , still , below the previous year , with a decline from EUR 265.8 million to EUR 251.4 million . Net profit for the period rose from EUR 221.1 million to EUR 229.3 million due to a lower tax rate . Gross cash flow rose by 19.9 % from EUR 252.9 million to EUR 303.2 million . Cash flow from operating activities increased to EUR 333.1 million , which reflects an improvement of EUR 62.7 million or 23.2 % in comparison with the first three quarters of 2009_10 ( EUR 270.4 million ) . This development resulted chiefly from the reduction of receivables ( EUR 181.3 million ) . Operating cash flow , which comprises cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities , more than tripled to EUR 381.3 million for the first three quarters of the reporting year ( 2009_10 EU R 111.5 million ) . This development resulted above all from the proceeds on property sales , which significantly exceeded investment costs . NAV per share and earnings per share Diluted net asset value ( NAV ) per share rose from EUR 4.78 on 30 April 2010 to EUR 5.13 as of 31 January 2011 . This increase is attributable to the sound earnings generated during the first three quarters of 2010_11 as well as the positive effects of the share buyback program . Based on the share price as of 31 January 2011 ( EUR 3.22 ) , the IMMOFINANZ share traded at a discount of 37.2 % to the NAV . Diluted earnings per share for the first three quarters of the reporting year amounted to EUR 0.23 , which represents an increase of more than 15.0 % over the comparable prior year period ( 2009_10 EUR 0.20 ) . Gross return and occupancy in the standing investments The third quarter also brought a significant improvement in property indicators . The occupancy rate in the IMMOFINANZ properties amounted to 89.0 % as of 31 October 2010 , but rose to 89.7 % by the end of January 2011 . The gross return on the standing investment portfolio , which equaled 6.6 % for the first half-year , increased to 6.9 % in the third quarter .

"FINNAIR PLC STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE 31 March 2011 AT 15.10 Finnair Technical Services ' employee consultations , which began in mid-February , were completed today . The consultation process concerned Finnair 's plans to discontinue unprofitable repair and overhaul , mainly offered to external companies . The personnel in Finnair Technical Services will be reduced by 450 people , of which just under 100 may be implemented through business transfers . The final number of redundancies will depend significantly on how much of the required reduction can be implemented through retirement and other voluntary solutions agreed in the YT negotiations as well as through the implementation of transfers of business . As part of the planned restructuring , Finnair Technical Services Oy and Finland Transval Oy have today signed a letter of intent on a possible transfer of business of Finnair Technical Services ' Helsinki-Vantaa warehouse services . Around 75 people work in these warehouse operations . In the letter of intent , it has been agreed to continue negotiations on a possible transfer of business . During Finnair Technical Services ' YT negotiations , on effort has been made in cooperation with personnel representatives to find alternatives to redundancies , and compensation for redundancies has also been discussed . ` The negotiations have been exacting for all of the parties concerned . Nevertheless , we cooperated well in the negotiations to build alternative solutions , and we also discussed compensation for redundancies . Finnair Technical Services ' financial situation is difficult , but even so our goal has been to offer those affected by the personnel reduction opportunities for re-employment and support during the transition period , ' says Kimmo Soini , Managing Director of Finnair Technical Services . ` Such a large personnel reduction and restructuring is regrettably unavoidable , because base maintenance of aircraft , done mainly for external customers , is deeply unprofitable . In addition , Finnair 's own fleet is one of the most modern in the world , so our own maintenance capacity requirement is lower than in the past , ' continues Soini . Further details on Finnair Technical Services ' personnel reduction plan and the number of redundancies will be announced in the spring , when interest in the available alternative solutions becomes clear . Finnair Technical Services , which specialises in aircraft and component repair and overhaul as well as in engine and landing gear repair and overhaul , currently has 1,600 employees .

Given the ongoing economic recovery , the preconditions for achieving this objective are good . Following a solid 2010 business year , CENIT expects renewed growth in 2011 . From the current vantage point , the enterprise assumes that sales and results growth of approx . 10 % ( adjusted for special factors ) can be achieved for both the consolidated and the individual financial statements . For the subsequent 2012 business year , we expect growth rates in the same order of magnitude . As a qualification , we must however note that these growth forecasts are highly contingent on the further development of the economy in Germany and in our target markets worldwide , as well as on the willingness of our customers to continue investing . With the acquisition of conunit GmbH in the summer of 2010 , CENIT was able to add important new elements to its portfolio . In future , we will also be able offer our clients services in the future-oriented field of business intelligence ( BI ) . Enterprises and customers have an urgent need to address this topic . Indeed , major analysts such as Gartner , PAC , Forrester and IDC list the issue as one of the most important IT themes of the coming years .

We intend to leverage the following factors toward increased sales and results targets The enterprise will continue its activities both in Europe and the US . Additionally , we will sound out new opportunities in the Pacific and East Asia regions . Aside from acquiring new customers , a prime focus will lie on growth in the relevant market segments .

Year 2010 The business conditions improved in 2010 in all our operating countries the markets grew moderately in the Nordic countries and the recovery from the economic crash began in the Baltic countries . We estimate that the low point of the economic conditions for us was in late 2009 _ early 2010 . During year 2010 we got back to the growth track and our net sales grew in all other areas except Sweden , and even there the last quarter produced growth . One of the highlights was that the business in the Baltic countries grew and was again profitable , which was especially positive after the deep recession and the restructuring actions caused by it . Our profitability improved during the year and each quarter was better than the previous one . Early part of the year was still weak , but the second half was clearly better . During the year we invested in developing our Swedish operations we changed the local management in early 2010 and have forward-lookingly built the local organization since then , targeting a significant growth in 2011 . Our order backlog grew to a record level in 2010 , which gives us a good base for future . Strategy As every year , we have reviewed and updated our strategy . We keep the principal strategic policies intact . We continue to focus closely on Business Intelligence ( BI ) solutions , aiming to outstrip the markets in the growth of our net sales and to achieve profitability that is among the best in our business segment . We believe that our customers will focus even more on the identifiable business benefits of their IT investments and will also need a growing scope of our solutions . Current focus themes include e.g. linking business execution to strategy , better performance management , collaborative decision making and master data management . In connection with the strategy update , we are introducing Enterprise Information Management ( EIM ) as the definition of our main focus area instead of the plain Business Intelligence .

In terms of vision , we simplified the definition of our operating area from the Nordic and Baltic regions to Northern Europe , where we aim to be the leading provider of EIM solutions in terms of both net sales and business result and measured by customer and employee satisfaction . An important component of our growth strategy is to achieve a significant status in Sweden with its extensive market , where our current relative position is weaker than elsewhere .

"<BR> <BR> THIS AD HOC RELEASE AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN ARE NOT BEING <BR> ISSUED AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , CANADA , <BR> JAPAN OR AUSTRALIA . <BR> <BR> <BR> Commerzbank intends to largely reduce silent participations of SoFFin <BR> <BR> Through to June 2011 Commerzbank is planning to redeem around EUR 14.3 <BR> billion of the EUR 16.2 billion in silent participations currently provided <BR> by the Financial Market Stabilization Fund ( SoFFin ) . EUR 11.0 billion are <BR> to originate from a corporate action in which , upon the occurrence of <BR> certain conditions , SoFFin will also participate in accordance with its <BR> shareholding . Other silent participations amounting to EUR 3.27 billion are <BR> to be repaid from excess regulatory capital . The then remaining approximate <BR> sum of EUR 1.9 billion in silent participations is to be redeemed from <BR> future excess regulatory capital by 2014 at the latest . <BR> <BR> From April 6 , 2011 onwards conditional mandatory exchangeable notes , <BR> so-called CoMEN , are to be placed through a book building process . <BR> Commerzbank shareholders with the exception of SoFFin will receive purchase <BR> rights for these . The purchase period begins on April 7 , 2011 . It is <BR> planned to automatically convert the CoMEN into Commerzbank shares <BR> following the adoption of the corresponding resolutions by the Annual <BR> General Meeting ( AGM ) and upon the occurrence of certain other conditions . <BR> The shares are to be issued via a conditional capital still to be created <BR> through the conversion of SoFFin silent participations . In order to <BR> maintain its shareholding of 25 % plus 1 share , SoFFin is converting <BR> additional silent participations into shares . As a second step a capital <BR> increase with subscription rights is foreseen . So as to maintain its <BR> shareholding of 25 % plus 1 share SoFFin is contributing silent <BR> participations . The rights issue will probably take place from the end of <BR> May to the beginning of June 2011 . The shares created in the first step <BR> will be entitled to subscription rights . <BR> <BR> In the framework of the transaction a total of some EUR 8.25 billion is to <BR> be raised from the capital markets . In addition , silent participations to <BR> the amount of some EUR 2.75 billion are to be converted into Commerzbank <BR> shares or contributed as part of the rights issue . The necessary <BR> resolutions for the implementation of the planned corporate action are to <BR> be adopted at the ordinary AGM of Commerzbank AG , which has been brought <BR> forward to May 6 , 2011 . <BR> <BR> In connection with the early redemption of the silent participations SoFFin <BR> is receiving a one-off payment of EUR 1.03 billion . The silent <BR> participations in the amount of EUR 14.3 billion which are to be redeemed <BR> early will not be entitled to servicing for 2011 . <BR> <BR> For the first quarter of 2011 the bank is , on the basis of the first <BR> preliminary figures , expecting an operating profit above plan . In total the <BR> bank assumes it will conclude 2011 , given a stable market environment and <BR> without taking into account the one-off payment to SoFFin , with an <BR> operating profit according to IFRS that is higher than the level from 2010 . <BR> The one-off payment to SoFFin will already be accounted for in the second <BR> quarter of 2011 . From today 's stance Commerzbank expects to be able to pay <BR> a dividend for the financial year 2012 . Following the planned transaction <BR> and taking into account the one-off payment to SoFFin , the transaction <BR> costs and the corporate actions performed at the beginng of 2011 , the Core <BR> Tier 1 ratio amounts to 8.8 % , the Equity Tier 1 ratio to 8.0 % ( on a pro <BR> forma basis as of December 31 , 2010 ) . <BR> <BR>",4.174103,4.421368,True,True

"NEWS RELEASE International Minerals Updates Reserve and Resource Estimates at Pallancata Silver Mine Scottsdale , Arizona , April 6 , 2011 , International Minerals Corporation ( Toronto and Swiss stock exchanges ` IMZ ' ) reports updated mineral reserve and resource estimates for the Pallancata silver mine , jointly owned by IMZ ( 40 _ interest ) and Hochschild Mining plc ( ` Hochschild ' , 60 _ interest ) based on information supplied by Hochschild , the mine operator , as at December 31 , 2010 . Resources and Reserves reported below ( and detailed in Table 1 ) are estimated using a marginal cut-off grade of 147 grams per tonne ( ` g_t ' ) silver equivalent , which reflects a marginal cut-off value of US$ 55 per tonne using conservative metal prices of US$ 15.00 per ounce of silver and US$ 900 per ounce of gold . Proven and Probable ( ` P_P ' ) Reserve estimates ( on a 100 _ basis ) . , 38.5 million ounces of silver and 182,000 ounces of gold contained within 3.9 million tonnes ( ` Mt ' ) at an average grade of 308 g_t silver and 1.5 g_t gold . 40 _ of these reserve ounces are attributable to IMZ . Although this updated Reserve estimate represents a year-over-year ( ` YOY ' ) decrease in contained ounces of 13 _ for silver and 5 _ for gold , ongoing exploration drilling has the potential to replace the production on a year-by-year basis . Mine life continues to be approximately 4 years on a reserve basis with additional mine planning and underground development required to upgrade the current M_I and Inferred Resources to Reserves . Measured and Indicated ( 'M _ I ' ) Resource estimate ( on a 100 _ basis and including P_P Reserves ) . , 60.6 million ounces of silver and 280,000 ounces of gold contained within 4.9 Mt at an average grade of 385 g_t silver and 1.8 g_t gold . 40 _ of these resource ounces are attributable to IMZ . This updated M_I Resource estimate represents a YOY decrease in contained ounces of 10 _ for silver and 3 _ for gold Inferred Resource estimate ( on a 100 _ basis ) . , 25.4 million ounces of silver and 104,000 ounces of gold contained within 2.4 Mt at an average grade of 329 g_t silver and 1.3 g_t gold . 40 _ of these resource ounces are attributable to IMZ . This updated Inferred Resource estimate represents a YOY increase in contained ounces of 32 _ for silver and 35 _ for gold . Commenting on the updated resource and reserve estimates , Stephen Kay , President_CEO of IMZ said , ` The overall resources continue to grow at Pallancata , showing that the mine can consistently replace its production through successful exploration programs . During 2011 , an aggressive exploration and development drilling campaign will continue , which is designed to both define new resources and to convert existing resources into reserves . IMZ expects that the mine will continue to be one of the largest and lowest cost silver producers in the world for many years to come . ' In 2010 the Pallancata mine produced 10.14 million ounces of silver and 35,848 ounces of gold . Since commencement of production in September 2007 ( at 500 tonnes per day ) to December 31 , 2010 ( at 3,000 tonnes per day ) , the Pallancata operation has processed approximately 2.5 million tonnes of material and produced 23.4 million ounces of silver and 86,700 ounces of gold . IMZ expects that the mine will produce approximately 9.3 million ounces of silver and 36,500 ounces of gold during calendar year 2011 , with 40 _ of those ounces attributable to IMZ . The slight decrease in projected silver production in 2011 over 2010 is due primarily to the mine being able , at current metal prices , to exploit lower grade areas at a lower cut-off grade of 147 g_t silver equivalent compared to 160 g_t silver equivalent in the previous year .

"( Essen , 11 April 2011 ) According to provisional estimates , secunet Security Networks AG , a leading German supplier of sophisticated IT security solutions and IT security partner to the Federal Republic of Germany , posted revenue for the months from January to March 2011 of EUR 10.2 million and earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) of EUR -1.4 million . The results are well short of last year 's revenue figure of EUR 13.3 million and EBIT of EUR 0.1 million and are therefore also below the Management Board 's expectations for the first quarter of 2011 . The difference in revenue is largely due to the continuing postponement of major orders from the German armed forces , which already impacted last year 's revenue . The drop in EBIT is mainly attributable to the absence of these revenues . Order backlog at 31 March 2011 amounted to EUR 27.8 million compared with EUR 25.9 million as of the same reporting date last year . The Management Board 's expectations for the 2011 financial year will be strongly influenced by the aforementioned major orders , the implementation of which will be decided in the coming weeks . secunet Security Networks AG Corporate Communications Dr Kay Rathke Tel +49 ( 0 ) 201 5454 1221 E-Mail kay.rathke@secunet.com 11.04.2011",-0.9661889,-1.951448,False,False

"Due to the reduction of the profit forecast of its Australian subsidiary Leighton , HOCHTIEF has reduced its own forecast for the current business year 2011 . Depending on the volume and result of the share divestment in HOCHTIEF Concessions , the Management Board of HOCHTIEF expects a reduction of the group profit before tax to half of last year 's group profit before tax . The consolidated net group profit is expected to exceed last year 's consolidated net profit . The HOCHTIEF profit forecasts for the business years 2012 and 2013 are still not affected . The adverse effects on the profits of Leighton are in particular caused by a loss expected for the road project Airport Link in Brisbane , a significantly reduced profit expectation for the construction project Victoria Desalination Plant close to Melbourne as well as a write-down of the book value of Leighton 's holding in the Habtoor Leighton Group and a provision for not yet recovered receivables at Habtoor Leighton Group . Leighton made an announcement in this respect to its shareholders this morning after it had completed the announced review of its profit forecast . In addition , Leighton has announced a capital increase with subscription rights in the amount of AUD 757 million . The proceeds from the capital increase are supposed to be used to improve Leighton 's balance sheet ratio , provide financial flexibility for growth and support investment grade credit rating metrics . HOCHTIEF will participate in this capital increase corresponding to the percentage of its shareholding in Leighton .",-9.592426,-8.782381,False,False

"- Edisun Power Europe Ltd. enjoys marked sales increase in 2010 business year. , Currency losses and one-off effects weigh on result. , Further expansion of capacity intended with strategic partners . Edisun Power Europe Ltd. was able to post a marked sales increase in the 2010 business year with the construction of new solar power facilities . One-off effects and currency losses weighed on the result and led to a net loss of CHF 1.07 million . The Board of Directors intends to grow through strategic partners so as to take full advantage of the considerable potential of the solar power market . In the 2010 business year , Edisun Power Europe Ltd. ( Edisun Power ) , a company specializing in solar power with headquarters in Zurich and solar facilities throughout Europe , was able to increase sales by 120 % year on year . Earnings from power production , the Group 's core business , grew over 2009 by 23 % ( 30 % at constant exchange rates ) . Some of its larger facilities , as for example the 850-kilowatt plant installed on the roofs of the Pistor company in Rothenburg ( canton of Lucerne ) , were not connected to the grid until the end of 2010 , and thus had only a reduced effect on earnings . One-off impairments on projects and solar modules led to a reduction in operating profit ( EBIT ) over the previous year to TCHF 60 ( 2009 TCHF 331 ) . The net loss after currency losses and extraordinary write downs comes to TCHF -1073 . Cash flow was increased overall by CHF 1.7 million , while capital expenditures occasioned liquidity outflows of CHF 7.7 million , and financing activities brought in some CHF 6 million . International profile strengthened Electricity sales abroad already account for 64 % of Edisun Power 's earnings , as against 57 % in 2009 . In future , dependency on the euro is to be sharply reduced . While in the past international projects had been financed practically in their totality in Swiss francs , Edisun Power has since 2009 been building facilities abroad only where local financing could be secured . The construction and sale of a 610-kilowatt facility in 2010 was a first step in the direction of plant construction for third parties , and the company intends to continue expanding this new service in future . At year 's end a bond issue brought in an additional CHF 5.8 million , funds that are being used to construct facilities in Switzerland and strengthen the company 's balance sheet . As per balance-sheet day the Group enjoyed a solid equity ratio of 31 % ( 2009 41 % ) despite book losses induced by currency effects . Growth strategy with strategic partners The 2010 annual statement takes into account all necessary impairments , allowing Edisun Power to focus all of its abilities on the operation of solar power plants and the construction of new facilities . At its present size , Edisun Power is not yet able to take full advantage of the potential of the rapidly growing solar power market . So as to double its earnings from the sale of electricity over the next 12 months as planned , the Board of Directors has decided to call on the aid of strategic partners . If , however , it should not be possible to establish such partnerships in the 12 months to come , which the Board of Directors believes unlikely , it reserves the right to preserve shareholder value by focusing on optimizing return on existing solar power facilities and making the necessary structural adjustment .

"The HOCHDORF Group has made a good showing in business year 2010 , a year that was challenging both politically and economically . It is now turning a profit again following a year of negative company results ( CHF _ 4.1 million net profit , previous year CHF -5.1 million ) . Operational results have also improved . The group increased its EBIT by 20 per cent to CHF 4.1 million ( previous year CHF 3.4 million , _ 19.8 _ ) . To further increase the internationalisation process , the board of directors is requesting that the annual general meeting approves conditional share capital amounting to a maximum of CHF 4.5 million for a conversion loan . The planned capital market transaction will be synchronised with the change from the BXBerne Exchange to the SIX Swiss Exchange ( Segment Domestic Standard ) . The HOCHDORF Group achieved a gross turnover of CHF 351.4 million ( previous year CHF 346.3 million , _ 1.5 _ ) and processed a total of 410.5 million kg of milk and whey ( previous year 320.4 million kg , _ 28.1 _ ) . In Switzerland , the processed milk quantity increased by just _ 1.7 _ from 320.4 to 325.9 million kg . In addition to this milk quantity , HOCHDORF also dried 13 million kg of whey . Approximately 71.6 million kg of milk was processed by the plant taken over by the HOCHDORF Group in Lithuania . HOCHDORF also achieved record results in terms of sales volume , selling 94,657 tonnes of products in total . The group was able to show substantial increases in the EBITDA ( CHF 16 million , previous year CHF 13.9 million ) and the EBIT ( CHF 4.1 million , previous year CHF 3.4 million ) in both absolute and relative terms ( in _ of the production revenue ) . A satisfactory overall result Compared to company losses of CHF 5.1 million in the previous year , the HOCHDORF Group turned a profit in the 2010 business year amounting to CHF 4.1 million . ` These figures prove that we are on the right track , ' says a delighted Damian Henzi , CEO of the HOCHDORF Group . This level of revenue was achieved despite extraordinary costs , such as , for instance , currency influences , a reduction in the funds previously available from the ` Schoggi ' law and running in costs for the new spray tower line , as well as additional amortisation , amounting to CHF 5.3 million in total . Good results , a team effort The entire HOCHDORF Group had a hand in the positive business results . As of 1 January 2010 , HOCHDORF Swiss Milk AG took on a 30 _ holding in the milk plant UAB MGL Baltija in Medeikiai ( Lithuania ) . Since there will be a 100 per cent takeover of the plant by 1 January 2014 , it has already been completely incorporated into the accounts . As of 1 January 2011 , HOCHDORF Swiss Milk AG increased its share to 45 _ . The baby foods business area showed very positive development . HOCHDORF Nutricare AG achieved a 70 per cent growth in turnover and is already selling HOCHDORF baby foods in over 20 countries . HOCHDORF Nutrifood AG has developed an innovative baby food for a Swiss customer with milk fat , as well as rapeseed oil , sunflower oil and linseed oil . This product is to be seen as a response to increasing consumer resistance to the frequently-used palm oil . HOCHDORF Nutribake AG achieved its growth primarily in the bakery products industry and less in bakery sales . Nonetheless it still managed a slight increase in market share in the continually shrinking bakery sales area . Forecast for 2011 ` In the current business year , we are investing heavily in increased and more regular capacity utilisation at our existing plants in Hochdorf , Sulgen and Medeikiai , ' explains Damian Henzi . ` We will also continue to pursue the optimisation and restructuring measures introduced two years ago , ' he adds . It is in this context that the baby foods business will be incorporated into HOCHDORF Nutricare AG as of 1 July 2011 . HOCHDORF Nutricare AG and HOCHDORF Nutrifood AG are currently selling and developing baby foods . Henzi also says that the group will continue with its internationalisation process in the current business year . He is convinced that many markets could be conquered with ` Made in Switzerland ' quality products and the HOCHDORF high level of service . A request will be made to the annual general meeting on Friday 13 May 2011 to retain the dividend of CHF 3.0 per share . The dividend payment is to be taken entirely from the capital investments whereby there is no withholding tax deduction and the revenue is tax free for individuals who are resident in Switzerland .

"elexis AG ad-hoc announcement in accordance with 15 of the Securities Trading Act ( WpHG ) on the provisional results of the first three months of 2011 * Sharp rise in incoming orders to 49.0 million euros ( + 38 percent ) * Sales of 41.3 million euros as at 31 March 2011 ( previous year 29,8 million euros , + 39 percent ) * The Group has returned to its previous earning power with an EBIT margin of 14.3 percent * All divisions back on track following the financial and economic crisis Wenden , 15 . April 2011 , The elexis Group , which is listed on the SDAX and specialises in factory automation , has made a successful start to 2011 . In the first quarter all of the Group 's divisions put the global financial and economic crisis behind them . In addition to the continued dynamic demand from the high-growth BRIC states , demand from the Group 's regular customers in the USA is also picking up . Incoming orders , sales and earnings According to provisional calculations , incoming orders increased by around 38 percent and amounted to 49.0 million euros as at 31 March 2011 ( previous year 35.5 million euros ) . Sales amounted to 41.3 million euros following 29.8 million euros in the previous year . This equates to an increase of 39 percent . The book-to-bill ratio is 1.19 . The cost savings achieved in 2009 and 2010 and the simultaneous growth in sales resulted in significant increase in earnings . The EBIT returned at 5.9 million euros ( previous year 1.6 million euros ) to the Group 's earning power prior to the financial and economic crisis . As at 31 March 2011 this equates to an EBIT margin 14.3 percent following 5.4 percent in the same quarter of the previous year . Development in the divisions The High Quality Automation division has already returned to the pre-crisis level in all product areas . This is shown by a clear increase in incoming orders and sales . According to provisional figures , incoming orders increased by 40 percent to 39.6 million euros ( previous year 28.2 million euros ) Sales amounted as at 31 March 2011 to 33.9 million euros following 26.7 million euros in the previous year ( + 27 percent ) . The High Precision Automation division is expected to record an increase in incoming orders and sales and a positive contribution to earnings for the second quarter in a row . Incoming orders increased from 7.3 million euros in the previous year to 9.4 million euros as at 31 March 2011 . According to provisional calculations , in the first quarter of 2011 sales more than doubled to 7.4 million euros ( previous year 3.1 million euros ) . In addition to demand picking up among existing customers in the USA , sales activities in China are also starting to get results . Outlook The elexis Group 's products stand for expertise in industrial production . elexis components make a positive contribution towards energy efficiency , for example by ensuring a financially significant reduction in rejects . They also stand for expertise in solving issues concerning the extraction of raw materials . Not least of all , it should be emphasised that the High Precision Automation segment makes a significant contribution towards industrial productivity in the plastics-processing industry . elexis AG 's strategic approach ensures wide-ranging productivity improvements as elexis 's current products can be used in a large number of industries . The Group is also active with its international sales network in more than 75 countries . Product expertise and technological and market leadership are the foundations for the elexis Group 's profitable growth in the future . The incoming orders in the first quarter are partly attributable to catch-up effects . The high growth rates can not therefore necessarily be used to provide a projection for the remainder of the year . However , we are expecting a significant increase in the current financial year in incoming orders , sales and earnings power compared to the previous year . As in previous years , the Management Board will provide detailed guidance at the annual general meeting on 19 May 2011 . The full interim report for the first three months of 2011 will be published on 5 May 2011 . At this time the report will be available for download in German and English at www.elexis.de .

With Group revenue of EUR 13.2 million ( previous year EUR 5.1 million ) , Viscom AG has achieved its highest first-quarter figures since its inception . EBIT is at EUR 2.9 million ( previous year EUR -1.6 million ) , corresponding to an EBIT margin of 22 % .

"Kronach , April 21 , 2011 , At EUR 61.5 million , Loewe Group sales in the first quarter of 2011 were 16 % lower than the 2010 figure of EUR 73.4 million . The reduced sales and production volume led to an EBIT loss for Loewe of EUR 2.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to positive EBIT of EUR 0.8 million in the year before . Generally , the first quarter of 2011 was still burdened by the necessary streamlining of the Loewe TV product line and intense price competition . Significant market participants started targeted retail sales campaigns particularly in the early weeks of the current fiscal year to compensate for the 2010 Christmas shopping season which failed to meet market expectations . For 2011 as a whole , Loewe nonetheless expects moderate growth in sales and positive EBIT . For the current year , Loewe will press ahead in protecting its future viability within the framework of ` Fast Forward . ' The focus will be on systematically continuing the themes initiated in 2010 . Specific plans include continuing the current product offensive with new 3D TV sets , further optimization of product costs in line with the platform strategy and the long-range brand strategy . In the current fiscal year , Loewe will also optimize the premium-based marketing of its top-quality products both within and outside of Germany through even closer cooperation with qualified retailers . Another focus of marketing and sales activities will be on expanding qualitative and quantitative distribution . The market offers good medium-range opportunities for Loewe . In addition to the continued replacement demand and the increasing ownership of more than one LCD TV in Europe , new technologies like 3D television , HbbTV ( the connection of television and the Internet ) will provide Loewe with stimuli that will last beyond the current fiscal year . Although Loewe is not directly affected at present , the risk does exist that the current situation in Japan might have an impact on the availability of production material . For the current fiscal year , the Loewe Group expects moderate growth in sales and positive EBIT . Moreover , Loewe 's sound capital structure and wide-ranging financing agreements continue to put the company in a strong position for future growth .",-3.127291,-3.676278,False,False

"* Group revenue up 10 % * Consulting revenue expanded by 6 % * Software business increases by 26 % * EBIT reduced * Net cash and cash equivalents remain stable Walldorf , April 21 , 2011 . As described in the Outlook of the Group Management Report of December 31 , 2010 , REALTECH succeeded in increasing revenues in both segments in 2011 . At the same time , earnings came under pressure , as expected , due to investments . Germany saw an increase in earnings while EBIT fell slightly . REALTECH Spain developed better than the country 's economy , but still has not made a positive contribution to income . The greatest decline was in Japan . The earthquake disaster caused a significant cease in orders , which had a corresponding effect on revenues and earnings . REALTECH USA was able to increase its profitability substantially while keeping revenues constant . To put this in figures , REALTECH AG recorded revenue of EUR 12.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 , 10 % up on the figure for the previous year ( first quarter of 2010 EUR 11.7 million ) . Consulting revenue rose by 6 % to EUR 9.6 million ( EUR 9.1 million ) . Revenues in the software segment rose by 26 % to EUR 3.3 million ( EUR 2.6 million ) . EBITDA ( earnings before interest , tax , depreciation , and amortization ) declined from EUR 0.5 million to EUR 0.2 million , while EBIT ( earnings before interest and tax ) fell from EUR 0.3 million to minus EUR 0.1 million . Net income decreased accordingly from minus EUR 0.1 million to minus EUR 0.2 million , which corresponds to earnings per share of minus EUR 0.04 compared to minus EUR 0.01 in Q1_2010 . At the end of March 2011 , net cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 8.9 million , compared with EUR 6.4 million at the end of 2010 and EUR 9.2 million at the end of last March . The Executive Board continues to believe its forecast and still expects to achieve revenue growth this year .

"- Result for the first quarter is expected to be much better than in the previous year Berlin , 21 April 2011 , POLIS Immobilien AG ( ISIN DE0006913304 ) reported a valuation result of approx . EUR 8 million for the first quarter ( previous year EUR -1.6 million ) . Accordingly , the result for the quarter is expected to be much better than in the previous year . The result from the revaluation of investment properties climbed to approx . EUR 6 million ( previous year EUR -0.1 million ) in the first quarter and benefited primarily from the three investment properties acquired in Dresden with effect from 1 January 2011 , which were recognized for the first time . The company was able to win new tenants immediately after the acquisition of these investment properties and also benefited from the fact that a lease for approx . 2,300 square metres of retail space was renewed at better conditions . Moreover , POLIS Immobilien was able to continue the good letting performance of the previous year and to increase the letting ratio to 79 % . The values continue to be determined at the time of acquisition of new investment properties and at least once a year by external appraiser Feri EuroRating Services . Since the last quarter 2010 , the market values of investment properties for which no fundamental changes have occurred and which were not valued by Feri at the end of the quarter have been determined in the context of internal valuation . POLIS Immobilien also benefited from the continued increase in interest rates . The rise in market rates led to a valuation gain on interest rate hedging instruments of EUR 2.3 million ( previous year EUR -1.5 million ) . The company uses interest rate hedges to hedge at least 50 to 70 percent of its loans against changes in interest rates . POLIS Immobilien intends to increase its income from property management in 2011 in order to lay the foundation for continued growth in 2012 . Given that much of the valuation result of the first quarter is due to the initial recognition of newly acquired investment properties and to changes in the valuation of financial instruments , comparable valuation results are not expected in the coming quarters due to the non-recurrent nature of these effects .",4.433505,4.433505,True,True

H and R WASAG AG generated an outstanding operating result ( EBITDA ) of EUR 34.7 million in the 1st quarter of 2011 . Thanks to a positive economic environment and the resulting strong ongoing demand for all product groups worldwide , H and R WASAG AG exceeded financial analysts ' expectations in the first three months of the year . Based on preliminary figures , revenues amounted to EUR 290.4 million in the 1st quarter ( previous year EUR 254.0 million ) , EBITDA came in at EUR 34.7 million ( previous year EUR 24.2 million ) and EBT totalled EUR 26.9 million ( previous year EUR 17.2 million ) .

In view of the natural and reactor catastrophes in Japan , and as a measure to match Kontron 's strong order growth , inventories were stocked up with important components and building blocks . This impacted operating cash flow , which , at EUR 2.9 million , was nevertheless still significantly ahead of the previous year 's operating cash flow of minus EUR 7.7 million . In view of demand growth and the company 's high order book position , Kontron AG is assuming that the dynamic business trend will continue over the coming months .

"VERBUND , Austria 's leading electricity company , presents a considerable better operating result in quarter 1_2011 , but a declining Group result due to one-off effects in the previous year that do not apply in the current reporting period .

This positive trend can be attributed above all to an increase in own generation from hydropower on the part of VERBUND . At 0.99 , the hydro coefficient may have been 1 % below the long-term average , but it was 7 percentage points above the previous year 's level . Therefore , generation at the run-of-river power plants increased considerably compared to the same period in the previous year . In contrast , generation at the annual storage power plants decreased as a result of the lower storage levels at the beginning of the year . Thermal generation was also up . This can be attributed to a stronger use of the thermal power plants in Austria as well as the purchase of full electricity from the Pont-sur-Sambre power plant in France since 1 March 2011 . Overall , VERBUND 's own generation increased by 365 GWh . Group result decreased by 9.5 % to EUR108 .5 m. The decrease in the Group result can be attributed mainly to the positive one-off effect ( tax benefits for investments ) that affected the result from equity interests in Italian Sorgenia S.p.A.

Effects of the nuclear crisis in Japan As a consequence of the nuclear crisis in Japan , Germany temporarily shut down its seven oldest nuclear power plants as well as the earlier disconnected power plant KrÃ 1/4 mmel in the middle of March .

"Ad hoc ANNOUNCEMENT Announcement in accordance with Section 15 ( 1 ) of the German Securities Trading Act ( WpHG ) Dreieich , 28 April 2011 . The Board of Management of Biotest AG has adjusted its 2011 earnings targets for the Continuing Operations of the Biotest Group but affirmed its sales goal . This is due to events at the subsidiary Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation ( BPC ) , Boca Raton , USA , where problems with the automation and control software occurred upon the launch of the new production system . As a result , production of the polyspecific immunoglobulin BivigamTM will not begin until the second half of 2011 , a few months later than planned . Meanwhile , the processing of the application for marketing authorisation for BivigamTM by the US Food and Drug Administration continues to progress quickly and smoothly . The results of inspections conducted so far have been positive and have generated no concerns . Marketing authorisation for BivigamTM will nevertheless be delayed , as data from consistency batches , which must be submitted before authorisation is granted , will not be available until later in the year . Due the extended idle time of the facility and the necessary repairs , Biotest will incur additional expenses initially estimated at EUR7 to EUR8 million , which will have a negative impact on earnings . Therefore , the previous goal of a 1 % to 2 % increase in EBIT over 2010 can no longer be met . Earnings performance is also subject to increased uncertainty in light of further changes in prices for plasma proteins in some parts of the world . Sales of the Biotest Group in Continuing Operations in the first quarter of 2011 totalled EUR106 .5 million ( 2010 EUR102 .8 million ) . In light of this development , Biotest has affirmed its sales goal for 2011 ( 1 % to 2 % growth over 2010 sales ) .

"Heidelberg publishes preliminary figures for financial year 2010_2011 * Figures up on previous year and confirm own forecasts , free cash flow above expectations * Incoming orders up around 16 percent to EUR 2.757 billion * Sales up around 14 percent to EUR 2.629 billion * Operating result excluding special items for the first time after two years positive with EUR 4 million * Net result expected to be at around EUR -130 million * Free cash flow well into the black at approximately EUR 75 million Incoming orders and sales by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG ( Heidelberg ) in financial year 2010_2011 ( April 1 , 2010 to March 31 , 2011 ) were up on the previous year . The operating result improved considerably after two deficit years , moving back into the black . Heidelberg has therefore met its own forecasts . At a total of EUR 2.757 billion , preliminary incoming orders were up around 16 percent on the previous year 's figure of EUR 2.371 billion . Exchange rate effects accounted for around EUR 140 million of this . Preliminary sales by the Heidelberg Group increased by around 14 percent to EUR 2.629 billion ( previous year EUR 2.306 billion ) . This includes around EUR 135 million from exchange rate effects . The operating result improved significantly due to higher profit contributions and the savings made in the financial year . The preliminary result of operating activities excluding special items rose to EUR 4 million at the end of the financial year ( previous year EUR -130 million ) . Positive special items totaled EUR 2 million in financial year 2010_2011 as a whole . As expected , the huge increase in financing costs and non-recurring expenditure linked to the comprehensive capital restructuring undertaken by Heidelberg in the financial year had a significant negative impact on the financial result . The net result is therefore expected to be at around EUR -130 million in financial year 2010_2011 . At approximately EUR 75 million , preliminary free cash flow improved considerably over the reporting year as a whole ( previous year EUR -62 million ) basically thanks to a reduction in the annual loss and net working capital and thus exceeded the company 's own expectations . At EUR 637 million , preliminary incoming orders in the fourth quarter were down on the previous year 's figure ( EUR 678 million ) . This figure includes exchange rate effects amounting to EUR 12 million . Preliminary sales increased to EUR 746 million ( previous year EUR 715 million ) , with exchange rate effects accounting for EUR 19 million of this . The preliminary result of operating activities excluding special items for the quarter under review improved to EUR 30 million on the back of EUR 11 million in the same quarter of the previous year . In the fourth quarter alone , negative special items amounted to EUR 24 million , mainly due to provisions for office space reductions , concentration of Heidelberg sites and for ongoing optimizations . The preliminary free cash flow amounted to EUR -16 million in the fourth quarter due to outflows associated with the restructuring measures ( previous year EUR -47 million ) .

"Heliad Equity Partners ( ISIN DE000A0L1NN5 ) has today published its definitive figures for the 2010 financial year . The company generated consolidated sales from continuing operations of EUR 51 million ( IFRS ) in the 2010 financial year ( 2009 EUR 32 million ) . Operating earnings ( EBITDA ) rose year-on-year by EUR 8.3 million to EUR 7.1 million ( 2009 EUR -1.2 million ) and were thus within the forecast target corridor . At EUR 9.7 million , consolidated net income at continuing operations significantly exceeded the previous year 's group net loss of EUR -10.0 million . Discontinued operations negatively affected consolidated net income with an amount of EUR -34.5 million , as a result of which consolidated net income allocable to limited shareholders amounted to EUR -19.4 million . The negative contribution from these operations was already accounted for as appropriate in the calculation of the company 's net asset value ( NAV ) at the end of the 2010 financial year , as a result of no further charge on NAV is applicable . At EUR 131 million , the total assets reported in Heliad 's consolidated balance sheet were 14 percent higher than in the previous year ( 2009 EUR 115 million ) . The equity ratio amounted to 39 percent of total capital . Liquid funds less financial liabilities increased to EUR 30.7 million ( 2009 EUR 16.8 million ) . The net asset value amounted to EUR 5.62 per share as of 31 December 2010 . As a result of the measures taken to optimise its structures , processes and portfolio , initiated in 2010 and currently still ongoing , Heliad has laid a good foundation to benefit from the expected continuation in the economic recovery in 2011 and subsequent years . In the current financial year , the company aims both to sell several investments and to acquire select new investments . The company 's management is therefore confident that , provided that the macroeconomic framework remains stably positive , the company will generated positive group earnings in the current year and will be able to increase its net asset value in the long term .

"Hamburg , 3 May 2011 , KROMI Logistik AG reported a rise in revenues of 13.8 % the first nine months of the 2010_2011 fiscal year ending 30 June , from EUR 23,393 thousand in the previous year to EUR 26,612 thousand . As part of this development , March 2011 represented KROMI Logistik AG 's highest revenue month since September 2008 . Adjusted for a one-off revenue effect in the previous year period , revenues would have been up by 19.1 % for the first nine months of the fiscal year 2010_2011 . In addition , the company has recorded a substantial increase in business with new customers since the beginning of the year and made further investments in future growth both domestically and abroad . The latter impacted earnings somewhat and led to a negative EBIT figure of EUR -594 thousand ( previous year EUR 193 thousand ) . On the back of this , the company has revised its earnings forecast for the full year downwards . Following the considerable rise in revenues , cost of materials was up 16.1 % from EUR 16,899 thousand to EUR 19,614 thousand . The resultant increase in the cost of materials ratio from 72.2 % to 73.7 % is attributable to the higher share of new customers in the portfolio year-on-year and the lower gross profit margin due to the resale of inventories purchased from new customers with which this is generally accompanied . This with new customers effect levels out over time . KROMI Logistik stepped up the implementation of its strategy of investing in new customers and markets on the back of the favourable conditions in the third quarter of the fiscal year . In the interim financial report , this is particularly evident in the increase in tool inventories to EUR 8,333 thousand ( 30 June 2010 EUR 6,485 thousand ) , the rise in trade receivables to EUR 9,958 thousand ( 30 June 2010 EUR 7,325 thousand ) , the growth in trade payables to EUR 5,050 thousand on the reporting date ( 30 June 2010 EUR 2,517 thousand ) and the increase in other operating expenses to EUR 3,580 thousand ( previous year EUR 2,809 thousand ) . In addition , this development was also reflected in the following non-balance sheet items As of 31 March 2011 , KROMI employed more than 100 employees for the first time ( 104 ) . 21 new employees were appointed in the first three quarters of the fiscal year , primarily at the company 's international locations . The increased staff costs of EUR 4,185 thousand over the nine month period ( previous year EUR 3,649 thousand ) only partially reflect this development as the appointments were made successively over the course of the year . In addition , the accelerating growth is also illustrated by the development of installed service desks and tool dispenser units 18 service desks and 46 dispenser units have been installed for our customers since the start of the fiscal year on 1 July 2010 . On that date , a total of 89 service desks and 285 tool dispenser units were in the hands of customers . During the entire previous fiscal year 2009_2010 , the number of customer installations hardly changed on balance due to the financial crisis . Overall , operating earnings ( EBIT ) were impacted by the implementation of the supply system for new customers , the increased sales activities as well as the aforementioned further investments in the establishment and development of the company . Although several of the already contracted new projects will only generate revenues in the next fiscal year , the Managing Board anticipates that the company will still achieve the forecast revenues rise to EUR 37 , 38 million over the full year . In contrast , operating earnings will remain at around the current nine month level , and consequently not reach the approx . EUR 1 million mark as forecast at the end of H1 . KROMI Logistik AG will publish its full 9-month report for the fiscal year 2010_2011 on 11 May 2011 at www.kromi.de in the Investor Relations section . Contact",0.0,0.6815547,True,True

Nanogate AG ( ISIN DE000A0JKHC9 ) , the leading international integrated systems provider for nanosurfaces , returns to profitability with record sales . In doing so , the company benefited from the sharp growth in demand and the newly acquired equity holding in GfO AG . With sales increasing by 95.7 % to EUR 20.9 million , the adjusted EBIT figure came to EUR 1.0 million ( EBIT before adjustment EUR -0.2 million ) . In the financial year 2011 , sales are scheduled to increase to more than EUR 30 million and the Group should make a full return to profitability with an EBITDA margin of at least 10 % . In the medium term , Nanogate is expecting sales of at least EUR 50 million and an EBITDA margin of over 20 % . With the takeover of the Dutch firm Eurogard B.V. that it has announced , the Group is establishing itself as the leading international integrated systems provider for nanosurfaces . Ralf Zastrau , CEO of Nanogate AG , commented ` Nanogate generated record sales in 2010 and its operating business has returned to profitability . Parallel to this , Nanogate considerably enhanced its strategic development . Thanks to additional competencies provided by our new equity holdings in Eurogard and GfO , we now cover the entire value chain . As the leading international integrated systems provider for nanosurfaces , we occupy the market for high-performance surfaces like no other . The combination of materials expertise with years of experience in process integration and mass production for all surface geometries is unique in Europe . In 2011 we are going to grow further and benefit above all from the strategic and operational steps we have taken over the past few months . We are expecting the Group to increase its sales to more than EUR 30 million and to achieve an EBITDA margin of at least 10 % . Our new equity holding Eurogard will already be making a contribution to earnings this year . In addition , we anticipate initial joint projects and customers as well as synergy effects . ' Positive EBIT in the second half-year Sales increased particularly strongly in the second half of the year , with Nanogate benefiting for the first time from its newly acquired equity holding GfO AG , which has been consolidated since September . In the second half of the year , sales were up by more than 130 % to EUR 15.3 million . With EBIT amounting to EUR 1.5 million ( previous year EUR -0.2 million ) , the Group returned to profitability in the six-month period from July to December . In the year as a whole , Nanogate increased its Group sales by 95.7 % to EUR 20.9 million ( previous year EUR 10.7 million ) . Consolidated EBITDA came to EUR 4.9 million ( previous year EUR -1.2 million ) , equivalent to an EBITDA margin of 23.4 % , also reflecting one-off factors . This includes non-recurring effects which had a positive effect on earnings overall as well . With adjusted consolidated EBIT coming to EUR 1.0 million , Nanogate moved into the profit zone in its operational activities . The non-recurring expenses at HOLMENKOL , other advisory expenses and transaction costs for the GfO investment totalling EUR 1.1 million , have been subtracted . Consolidated EBIT improved considerably to EUR -0.2 million ( previous year EUR -2.2 million ) despite the non-recurring effects , nearly reaching break-even again in 2010 as a whole . In its core business area of Multifunctional Surfaces , the Group generated a segment margin of 12.5 % . After taxes and minority interests consolidated net income was EUR 1.5 million ( previous year net loss of EUR 1.4 million ) , as the value of deferred tax assets went up sharply . Earnings per share improved to EUR 0.76 ( previous year EUR -0.72 ) . With business developing positively , the operating cash flow improved over the course of the year and was positive in the second half-year at EUR 0.3 million . Taking into account the non-recurring effects , for the year as a whole cash flow from operating activities came to EUR -0.8 million ( previous year EUR -1.1 million ) . The non-recurring expenses at HOLMENKOL , other advisory expenses and transaction costs for the GfO investment had a substantially negative effect here too . Notwithstanding the investment policy , the Group 's financial strength remains substantial cash and cash equivalents totalled approximately EUR 4.1 million at the end of 2010 ( previous year EUR 5.9 million ) , while the equity ratio came to 44.9 % ( previous year 61.4 % ) . Favourable order prospects secure growth The Group improved its results in all four target sectors in the last financial year . The Automotive_Mechanical Engineering division grew particularly strongly in 2010 . High-quality optical surfaces are increasingly in demand , especially for plastic surfaces in the automotive sector . The focus in this area is on integrated systems solutions that cover both the materials side and production . Nanogate has therefore pooled all core competences in the field of industrial high-performance surfaces in its subsidiary Nanogate Industrial Solutions in order to open up this market faster and make optimal use of internal synergies . The focus is primarily on innovative material systems for the application areas Buildings_Interiors and Automotive_Mechanical Engineering . At the same time , the optical division was moved to high-performance surfaces and integrated into Nanogate Industrial Solutions GmbH . The aim is to make use of the existing competences in optical solutions for the core high-performance surfaces business , as well as to examine other areas of application and realize synergies , even though optics is no longer part of the original strategic focus . The air filtration division improved its result significantly . The Sport_Leisure division benefited from product launches on the part of its customers , and the equity holding Holmenkol contributed to growth as well . With new projects for Audi , BMW and GEA Air Treatment , the dynamic business trend has continued into the current year . Order prospects at Group level now total in the mid double-digit millions range . Outlook for 2011 record sales of more than EUR 30 million anticipated Nanogate will benefit substantially in 2011 from the investments of recent months and the strategic transition to the leading integrated systems provider . The company intends to expand its market position in all four target areas Automotive_Mechanical Engineering , Buildings_Interiors , Sport_Leisure and Functional Textiles . The strong start to the year , with new orders from Audi , BMW and GEA Air Treatment for instance , as well as a new cooperation program with the Swiss company Kapyfract in the field of tunnel coatings , confirms the growth path . The inkjet technology for coating plastic surfaces , which is unique in Europe , should continue to drive sales . Business is also set to expand rapidly in the high-potential specialist areas energy efficiency and plastics , where margins are particularly profitable . The newly acquired equity holding Eurogard is additionally expected to achieve first market successes . At the present time Nanogate is forecasting profitable growth Group sales should rise to a new record of more than EUR 30 million . In announcing its acquisition of Eurogard B.V. , Nanogate has already increased its original forecast for 2011 . Now that Nanogate has recovered its operating profitability in the 2010 financial year and generated substantially positive EBIT in the second half of 2010 , the company will make a return to full profitability in 2011 . Correspondingly , Nanogate is expecting an EBITDA margin of at least 10 % for 2011 . In the medium term the Group intends to generate sales of more than EUR 50 million , with a sustainable EBITDA margin of more than 20 % . Thanks to non-recurring effects the EBITDA margin already reached this mark in 2010 . In the process , Nanogate will benefit in particular from its comprehensive competency in the field of enhancing high-performance surfaces on all surface geometries . Thanks to its equity holdings in Eurogard and GfO , the Group now has a full technology portfolio for material development and mass production that is unique in Europe .

Therefore , the following measures are to be implemented . , The divestment of ThyssenKrupp Waupaca within the context of a best owner process . Currently the company has sales of almost EUR900 million and around 3,000 employees . The company is the market leader in the area of iron casting in the USA . , The separation of ThyssenKrupp Tailored Blanks will also be carried out within the context of a best owner process . Tailored Blanks is system partner in the body and chassis manufacturing for the automotive industry and has sales of approx . EUR600 million and nearly 900 employees . , The bundling of the chassis business activities of the Bilstein Group and Presta Steering . The consolidation will result in one of the largest global Chassis-Full-Service-Providers with sales of around EUR2 .2 billion and nearly 6,500 employees . In addition , all alternatives for the new company are to be investigated , including the option of strategic partnerships . , The traditional springs and stabilizers business activities as well as the Brazilian Automotive Systems business with joint sales of approx . EUR700 million and more than 3,000 employees should be divested at the same time within the context of a best owner process .

All options regarding the continuation of its business activities outside the Group are to be investigated . In the last fiscal year the Business Area achieved sales of EUR5 .9 billion and had more than 11,000 employees . The separation from ThyssenKrupp will result in an independent European market and quality leader within the stainless steel industry , giving Stainless the opportunity to develop its competitive position with greater flexibility , also with regard to potential strategic partnerships . This will also result in more potential for additional structural improvements and cost savings . Current and prospective divestments within the context of portfolio alignment agreed upon by the Executive Board approximate EUR10 billion and 35,000 employees , based on the previous fiscal year . During the Press Conference following the Supervisory Board Meeting on May 13 , 2011 at 2 p.m. ThyssenKrupp will report about the decisions made regarding the prospective strategic development .

"elexis AG ad-hoc announcement in accordance with Â 15 of the Securities Trading Act ( WpHG ) on the final results of the first three months of 2011 * elexis confirms the provisional results of the first quarter of 2011 * Increase in incoming orders of 38 percent and rise in sales of 39 percent * EBIT more than tripled in comparison to the previous year and stood at 5.9 million Euros * Turnaround in the High Precision Automation division Wenden , May 5 2011 , The elexis Group , which is listed on the SDAX and specialises in production automation , confirms the provisional results for the first quarter of 2011 . Incoming orders , sales and earnings The incoming orders to the elexis Group increased in comparison to the same quarter in the previous year by 38 percent and stood at 49.0 million Euro on March 31 2011 ( previous year 35.5 million Euro ) . The sales revenues at the end of the first quarter of 2011 stood at 41.3 million Euro ( previous year 29.8 million Euro ) . That represents growth of 39 percent . The profits before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) rose from 1.6 million Euro in the previous year to 5.9 million Euro on March 31 2011 . The elexis Group achieved an EBIT margin of 14.3 percent , following on from 5.4 percent in the previous year . As such elexis attained the target of sustainably achieving an EBIT margin greater than 10 percent in the first quarter of 2011 . Development in the divisions The High Quality Automation division has returned to the pre-crisis level in all product areas . This is shown by a clear increase in incoming orders and sales . The incoming orders rose by around 40 percent to 39.6 million Euro ( previous year 28.2 million Euros ) . Sales amounted to 33.9 million Euro on March 31 2011 , following on from 26.7 million Euro in the previous year . This equates to an increase of 27 percent . The results before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) stood at 5.7 million Euro on March 31 2011 , following on from 3.4 million Euro in the same quarter of the previous year . This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 16.8 percent . In the previous year , the EBIT margin was 12.7 percent . With this development in profit the High Quality Automation division has once again attained the profit levels witnessed prior to the financial and economic crisis . The High Precision Automation division achieved increasing incoming orders and sales the second quarter in a row . Incoming orders rose from 7.3 million Euro in the previous year to 9.4 million Euro as at 31 March 2011 . In the first quarter of 2011 sales more than doubled to 7.4 million Euro ( previous year 3.1 million Euro ) . In light of the continuing rise in sales volumes the High Precision Automation division made a positive contribution to profits the second quarter in series . The results before interest and taxes stood at 0.6 million Euro on March 31 2011 , following on from minus 1.4 million Euro in the previous year . This corresponds to an EBIT margin of 8.1 percent . In the previous year , the EBIT margin was still negative , at minus 45.2 percent . Equity and other KPIs As was the case in the years preceding the financial crisis , the operative cash flow of the company group is characterised by an increased tying up of funds in net working capital and stood at minus 2.0 million Euro on March 31 2011 . In contrast , the same quarter in the previous year was influenced by ongoing cost optimisations with declining sales within the framework of the economic crisis , and was therefore not representative with a positive operative cash flow of plus 2.4 million Euro . With an equity capital quota of 52.5 percent ( December 31 2010 52.2 percent ) and increased net liquidity of 15.7 million Euro ( same quarter in the previous year 12.0 million Euro ) elexis demonstrated a solid financial basis in the reporting period . Outlook elexis products are key technologies in industrial manufacturing when it comes to increasing productivity , checking quality and guaranteeing the safety of the system . With the products and systems of the individual business divisions , the elexis Group is established across the entire added value chain of industrial manufacturing . When it comes to the megatrends health , mobility , new consumption patterns , environment and energy one is unable to avoid elexis products . And the megatrends are set to stay for the long term . The growth opportunities in the so-called megatrends are accompanied by the independent growth dynamics of the emergent nations , which will remain the driving force behind economics in the 2011 financial year . With a product portfolio aligned with consumers and an international sales network , the elexis Group has the best preconditions through which to participate fully in the pending market growth . The incoming orders in the first quarter are partly attributable to catch-up effects . The high growth rates can not therefore necessarily be used to provide a projection for the remainder of the year . However , we are expecting a significant increase in the current financial year in incoming orders , sales and earnings power compared to the previous year . As in previous years , the Management Board will provide detailed information on the expectations for the coming financial year at the annual general meeting on May 19 2011 .

"Wacker Neuson increases forecast on the basis of strong Q1 2011 performance ( Munich , May 9 , 2011 ) On the basis of a strong first quarter 2011 and promising prospects for the year overall , the Wacker Neuson Group has reviewed its revenue and earnings forecast for the entire fiscal year . In addition , company management expects to return to pre-crisis revenue levels earlier than anticipated . Q1 2011 was an exceptionally strong quarter for Wacker Neuson . The Group increased revenue compared to the same quarter last year by 40.9 percent to EUR 211.8 million ( Q1 2010 EUR 150.3 million ) . The EBITDA margin ( profit before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization ) rose much faster from 2.4 percent for the same quarter last year to 12.2 percent . Due to this backdrop , the Executive Board has reviewed the forecast for the entire fiscal year . They now expect revenue to increase between EUR 880 and 920 million ( which corresponds to a growth rate between 16 and 21 percent ) and the EBITDA margin to settle between 12 and 13 percent . Previously , the Group had projected that revenue would rise at least 15 percent to EUR 870 relative to 2010 's figure ( previous year EUR 757.9 million ) and that the EBITDA margin would be at least 12 percent ( previous year 10.3 percent ) .

The Executive Board 's current forecast does not include the one-off proceeds that would accrue to the company in the event of sale . The sales proceeds could , however , make a significant contribution to earnings . ) From today 's perspective and assuming the market continues to develop positively , the company expects to exceed pre-crises revenue levels ( the merged Wacker Neuson reported pro-forma revenue of around EUR 1 billion in 2007 ) one year earlier than anticipated in 2012 .

"The start to the new financial year was extremely promising for the technotrans Group Revenue reached EUR 24.1 million overall , representing a rise of 21.8 percent on the previous year ( EUR 19.8 million ) . Both the continuing moderate recovery in the printing industry and the acquisition of Termotek AG at the start of the year contributed to this development . Revenue for the Technology segment therefore climbed 39.6 percent . The rising revenue and the raft of measures to improve profitability clearly had an impact during the first quarter of 2011 . The operating result ( EBIT ) doubled in the first quarter and climbed to EUR 1.2 million ( previous year EUR 0.6 million , + 97.8 percent ) . At 5.1 percent , the EBIT margin was also well above the previous year 's level ( 3.2 percent ) . Because of certain tax effects net income after the first quarter was only EUR 0.5 million ( previous year EUR 0.3 million ) , equivalent to earnings per share of EUR 0.08 , based on shares outstanding ( previous year EUR 0.05 ) . Outlook Management plans for revenue in the order of EUR 100 million for the 2011 financial year ( previous year EUR 85.9 million ) and are aiming for an overall EBIT margin of between 6 and 7 percent ( previous year 3.5 percent ) . The first-quarter performance is in line with expectations and management is therefore confident about achieving that target . In order to identify and access additional long-term growth prospects for technotrans , some time ago a number of projects with the aim of finding additional applications in other industries for the core skills in liquid technology had been kicked off . In the meantime these efforts are bearing fruit as demonstrated by the contacts to Bio Circle and Sauer . Following intensive testing , Bio-Circle Surface Technology GmbH has decided to offer technotrans dosing systems complementing their own product range in Europe . The cooperation with SAUER GmbH , a company belonging to the GILDEMEISTER Group , is also developing successfully . Sauer offers machines to produce all dental indications in all materials . Following the successful completion of tests at the SAUER showroom , the first ` toolsmart ' , a technotrans device for cooling and filtering the cooling lubricant used during machining , will now be installed at customers .

Dr Soest was Managing Director of Gebr . Becker GmbH , Wuppertal , before joining technotrans AG in January 2011 as Technical Director . He is well-versed in handling innovation processes and will now be able to use this expertise to good effect in the management of technotrans .

"- First quarter ended with revenue of EUR 71.1 million and operating result of EUR 0.3 million , Export business up 14 % , export revenue share reaches 72 % , Important measures taken to secure further profitable growth , CENTROSOLAR benefits from new regulation in Italy , Revenue and earnings forecast confirmed Munich , May 10 , 2011 , CENTROSOLAR ended the first quarter with revenue of EUR 71.1 million ( previous year EUR 85.0 million ) . The company succeeded in increasing its export business by 14 % compared with the prior-year quarter , to EUR 51.0 million . As a result , 72 % of revenue was generated outside Germany . On the other hand the sales market in Germany performed distinctly more weakly than in the previous year as a result of sharp cutbacks in feed-in tariffs coupled with still-high solar cell prices . In the comparative period , the announced reduction in financial incentives mid-way through the year had produced a special boom that is atypical for the first half and is not expected this year . The market was characterised by starkly contrasting effects in the first quarter whereas demand in Germany was successfully held in check by the cutbacks to feed-in tariffs made in recent months , in Italy there were excessive feed-in tariffs until the start of March , these meant that cost improvements for wafers and solar cells were not passed on and that the raw material prices for solar silicon instead rose . Despite this difficult market environment , a positive operating result ( EBIT ) of EUR 0.3 million was achieved ( previous year EUR 8.2 million ) . Net earnings amounted to EUR -0.8 million ( previous year EUR 4.4 million ) . The company moreover performed important groundwork for further profitable growth during the past quarter . , The company created a new sales channel through its plans to expand production capacities at Wismar and the 5-year production agreement for 100 MWp p.a. with TSMC . , By expanding the sales organization in the USA for both systems business and mounting systems and commissioning a production line for anti-reflective solar glass in China , CENTROSOLAR has taken important steps towards maintaining its international expansion . , The financing of growth has been secured by the successful placement of a EUR 50 million bond . , The continuous improvement processes already successfully implemented in the Solar Integrated Systems segment were extended to the Solar Key Components business area . The company believes that these measures make it well-placed for further profitable growth . The format of the feed-in tariffs in the main sales markets has made it more difficult to issue sound forecasts for the business performance in the current financial year , changes to solar power incentives were made in Germany , Italy and France , the consequences of which can not yet be fully predicted . Nevertheless , following price reductions for solar cells and in light of positive expectations regarding the future incentivisation of solar power for roof systems , the company expects to see a substantial surge in demand in the second half of the year , even more so as the company should particularly profit from the new regulation of feed-in tariffs in Italy regulatory benefits apply for roof systems , building integrated systems , systems on refurbished roofs and systems with a high share of European content . Bearing in mind that CENTROSOLAR concentrates on the market segment of small and midsize roof systems , which attract preferential incentives not only in Italy , but also in Germany , France and many other countries , the company therefore confirms its revenue forecast of EUR 420 to 450 million with an EBIT margin of 4 to 6 % .",-1.299241,0.5735327,True,True

"Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Â 15 WpHG ( German Securities Trading Act ) Q-Cells SE publishes figures for the first quarter 2011 , Weak market and regulatory uncertainties burden first quarter , Sales of EUR 125.1 million and production of 313 megawatt peak in the first quarter , Operating income ( EBIT ) of EUR -10.6 million below the first quarter of the prior year ( EUR -9.3 million ) Bitterfeld-Wolfen , 11 May 2011 , Q-Cells SE ( QCE , ISIN DE0005558662 ) has recorded a significant drop in sales compared to the same period last year as a result of weak market demand in the first quarter of 2011 . Sales of EUR 125.1 million were approximately 46 percent below the value for the first quarter of 2010 ( EUR 232.3 million ) , which however included the sale of the utility-scale Strasskirchen project ( EUR 72.5 million ) and the electricity trading company QCCS ( EUR 20 million ) that was sold at the end of 2010 . The product business generated sales of EUR 98.7 million in the first quarter of 2011 . The seasonal weakness of the first quarter was aggravated by regulatory uncertainty in the important solar markets of France and Italy . Falling selling prices in the first quarter along with high prices for solar wafers and silver in combination with weak demand have negatively impacted the earnings position of the Company accordingly . Earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) totalled EUR 15.3 million , slightly below the prior year value of EUR 18.8 million . Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) at EUR -10.6 million for the first quarter of 2011 also came in slightly below the prior year period ( EUR -9.3 million ) . The net loss for the period was EUR -41.1 million ( Q1 2010 EUR -46.4 million ) . The production of solar cells and thin film modules totalled 313 MWp in the first quarter of 2011 . Of the 284 MWp solar cells , 163 MWp were produced in the Q-Cells plant in Malaysia . The production of thin film solar modules ( Q. SMART at the subsidiary Solibro ) amounted to 29 MWp ( +74 % compared to Q1 2010 ) . Net working capital increased from EUR 339.8 million to EUR 494.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 . As the first quarter of 2011 developed less favourably than in the previous year and the demand situation for the second quarter as well as the second half of 2011 is fraught with great unpredictability , a forecast for 2011 carries considerable uncertainties . The company 's target to achieve the same level of revenues as in the previous year can be reached , provided that demand increases in the second half of 2011 and production capacities are utilised accordingly . Due to the high degree of uncertainty about the future development of purchase and sales prices , Q-Cells is presently unable to provide a forecast for operating income in the current year . With an increase in demand in the second half of 2011 , a stabilisation of sales prices , falling prices for wafers and silver and the realisation of planned projects in the systems business , a positive operating income for the full year is to be expected .",-8.68217,-8.059688,False,False

"Phoenix Solar AG presents its figures as per 31 March 2011 - Business in the quarter slower than expected , Politics , the weather and the price trend hamper demand Sulzemoos 11 May 2011 _ Phoenix Solar AG ( ISIN DE000A0BVU93 ) , a leading photovoltaic system integrator listed on the TecDAX , is today presenting its figures for the first quarter of the current financial year . Factors influencing demand in the period under review were the winter weather in Europe and political plans to scale back the government promotion of photovoltaic power in a number of key European markets . In Germany , another reduction of the feed-in tariffs by 13 percent on 1 January 2011 led to a great deal of reticence on the part of end customers as the cuts were not fully compensated by the decline in prices . In France , a moratorium on the approval of photovoltaic power plants with more than 3 kilowatts peak was established in December 2010 through to the start of March . Following the boom year of 2010 , the Italian photovoltaic market was hindered by a protracted process of decision making by the Italian regulatory authority on future promotion which brought the market to a virtual standstill . Consolidated revenues As per 31 March 2011 , the revenues of the Phoenix Solar Group came to EUR 32.4 million in comparison to EUR 80.4 million posted in the first quarter of 2010 which was influenced by ` pull-in ' buying effects . The Components and Systems segment generated sales revenues of EUR 17.0 million , which corresponds to 52.5 percent . The Power Plants segment contributed EUR 15.4 million , which is 47.5 percent , to total revenues . A proportion of 71.9 percent , or EUR 23.3 million , was generated in markets outside Germany . The greatest contributions to these revenues came from the Components and Systems business in France and the power plants business in Italy and Greece . The volume of modules sold by the Group stood at 18 megawatts ( MW ) compared with 37 MW in the year-earlier quarter . EBIT and the consolidated result Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) amounted to EUR -16.9 million in the first quarter ( Q1_2010 EUR 4.6 million ) . The result was burdened by inventory depreciation of EUR 6.1 million , start-up costs of around EUR 1.0 million for entry into the US market and an increase in fixed costs as against the previous year 's quarter . The EBIT margin ( ratio of EBIT to revenues ) therefore came to -52.2 percent ( Q1_2010 5.7 percent ) . Consolidated result after tax stood at EUR -12.9 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 2.8 million ) . Earnings per share posted EUR -1.76 ( Q1_2010 EUR 0.42 ) . Against the backdrop of current developments in the market , the Executive Board has initiated a set of broad-based cost reduction measures throughout the whole Group . Order book As per 31 March 2011 , the Group 's order book came to EUR 178 million ( 31 March 2010 EUR 375 million ) , which is an increase of around EUR 20 million compared with year-end 2010 . The reason for the high level of orders in a quarterly comparison lies in the ` pull-in ' buying effects prevailing in Germany at this time . Orders of the Components and Systems segment came to EUR 42 million at the end of the first quarter 2011 ( 31 March 2010 EUR 227 million ) and to EUR 136 million in the Power Plants segment ( 31 March 2010 EUR 148 million ) . During the reporting quarter , there was a sharp increase in non-domestic orders to EUR 95 million , up from EUR 54 million in the first quarter of 2010 . Adjusted for power plant projects already under construction , orders on hand stood at EUR 52 million on 31 March 2011 . Performance in the second quarter The situation in the market improved initially only slightly in the second quarter . Demand in Germany and Italy was also very modest in April . The new conditions for promoting solar energy in Italy , which apply as from June 2011 , were released at the start of May . Owing to the special situation in the German market in 2010 , the current quarter will not be able to match the record year-earlier quarter in terms of both revenues and EBIT . Global market to stagnate in 2011 Following surging growth in the global photovoltaic market in 2010 , Phoenix Solar anticipates that there will be temporary stagnation at a high level ( 18 to 20 gigawatt ) throughout 2011 as a whole . In the medium and long-term , however , the sector 's outlook remains positive , and the Executive Board anticipates growth in the global market as early as 2012 onwards . Beginning in 2012 , the whole photovoltaic sector expects a decidedly positive influence to emanate from the nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima in Japan . The Phoenix Solar Group will also benefit from this development .

"Non-binding voluntary Translation Ad hoc announcement in accordance with Section Â 15 of the Securities Trade Act Advanced Inflight Alliance AG releases preliminary financial figures for first quarter of 2011 , Consolidated group revenues increased by about 10 percent to 28.9 million Euros , Pre-Tax profit more than quadrupled to 3.4 million Euros , Earnings per share increase from 0.03 Euro to 0.17 Euro Munich , May 12 , 2011 , Advanced Inflight Alliance AG ( ISIN DE0001262186 , WKN 126218 , located at Schellingstr . 35 , 80799 Munich ) releases preliminary Group figures for the first quarter of 2011 . The Advanced Inflight Alliance Group started exceptionally good into the financial year 2011 . Group revenues increased in the first quarter of 2011 by about 10 percent from 26.3 million Euros to 28.9 million Euros . This positive development reflects on one hand the continuing recovery of the aviation industry . On the other hand the strong development of business in the first quarter of 2011 is also due to a partial structural shift of revenues and earnings especially in the area of trade of licenses in the segment of inflight entertainment . As a result of this the first and third quarter of a financial year with two dates of changes of inflight entertainment content shows stronger revenues and earnings compared to the second and forth quarter of a financial year . As this partial structural shift did not affect the first quarter of 2010 in the same way , a direct comparison of the first quarter of 2011 with the first quarter 2010 is only possible to a limited extend . In the first quarter of 2011 the Advanced Inflight Alliance Group has more than doubled earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) from 2.0 million Euros in the first quarter of the previous year to 4.5 million Euros . This was primarily due to the above mentioned structural effects . In addition the Advanced Inflight Alliance Group was able to achieve an exceptionally good result in the first quarter of 2011 with the trade of film licenses in the segment of inflight entertainment due to a particularly suitable range of films offerd by the studios . The quality of the available films will continue to be decisive for the results in the film license trade business . Especially the cost saving measures also within the Groups Holding contributed to the very good results of the first quarter of 2011 . The first quarter of 2010 was impacted by one-time expenses of approximately 0.5 million Euros , which have to be considered in a direct comparison with the first quarter of 2011 . The EBITDA in the first quarter of 2011 contains reported negative foreign currency effects of TEUR 17 compared to the reported negative foreign currency effects of TEUR 518 in the first quarter of 2010 . The reported EBITDA adjusted for foreign currency effects in the first quarter of 2011 added up to 4.5 million Euros compared to 2.5 million Euros in the previous year . Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) rose from 1.1 million Euros in the first quarter of 2010 to 3.5 million Euros in the first quarter of 2011 . This reflects more than a triplication . The reported EBIT adjusted for foreign currency effects in the first quarter of 2011 added up to 3.5 million Euros compared to 1.6 million Euros in the previous year . The Advanced Inflight Alliance Group reported a profit before taxes ( EBT ) of 3.4 million Euros for the first quarter of 2011 . This compared with the previous year 's figure of 0.8 million Euros represents almost a quadrupling . The EBT adjusted for foreign currency effects in the first quarter of 2011 was 3.4 million Euros compared to 1.3 million Euros for the previous year . The net profit for the first quarter of 2011 of 2.5 million Euros also increased significantly the previous year 's figure of 0.5 million Euros . The net profit for the first quarter of 2011 adjusted for foreign currency effects was 2.5 million Euros compared to 1.0 million Euros in the first quarter of 2010 . With 0.17 Euros the earnings per share ( EPS ) according to IFRS in the first quarter of 2011 were well above previous year 's figure of 0.03 Euros ( EPS after foreign currency effects 0.17 Euros in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 0.06 Euros in the first quarter of 2010 ) .

"Ad-hoc notification in line with Section 15 WpHG First quarter 2011 Alphaform continues to post strong growth * Revenues up 35 % to EUR5 .8 million * Result improved , but still negative * Whole-year forecast confirmed Feldkirchen , 12 May 2011 , Alphaform AG , a specialist for additive manufacturing and a leading company in the manufacture of orthopaedic implants and instruments , improved consolidated revenues by 35 % to EUR5 .8 million in the first quarter of 2011 ( Q1 2010 EUR4 .3 million ) . Result before taxes ( operating result ) increased year-on-year by almost 44 % , but at EUR-0 .4 million still remained negative ( Q1 2010 EUR-0 .7 million ) . Key reasons for this were two months with low orders in the Prototyping business area , the temporarily necessary increase in the workforce to manage the high growth in Medical Technology and rising commodity prices . At the Stade site of the MediMet implant subsidiary , the introduction of 3-shift operation is being examined in order to reduce the order overhang and cope with the growth better . In the first quarter of 2011 , EBITDA increased against the equivalent period of the previous year from EUR-0 .2 million to EUR0 .0 million . Cash flow from operating activities increased by EUR1 .0 million from EUR-1 .8 million in the first quarter of 2010 to EUR-0 .9 million in the first quarter of 2011 . In the process depreciation and amortisation declined by almost EUR0 .2 million ( from EUR0 .5 million in Q1 2010 to EUR0 .3 million in Q1 2011 ) . In the first quarter of 2011 , the share generated a result of EUR-0 .08 per share , after EUR0 .14 in the first quarter of 2010 . Medical Technology continues strong growth In the Prototyping business area , Alphaform Group revenues lagged behind management expectations in the first quarter of 2011 . This was due to business starting only hesitantly in the first two months of the year . The development budgets of customers in the automotive and capital goods industries had been exhausted to the end of last year and in many cases were only renewed during February . However , since March 2011 order volumes are at and above planned levels . Revenues in the Medical Technology business area continued to develop very positively during the whole first quarter . As a result , the business areas increased its total share in consolidated revenues from 40 % during the whole of 2010 to 50 % in the first quarter of 2011 . What is more , one new customer was gained for the one-stop shopping implants concept Alphaform launched last year . Project work for this new customer starts in May 2011 . Talks with other potential customers are ongoing . Forecast for the whole of 2011 confirmed For the next quarter and for the whole of 2011 , Alphaform anticipates further revenues growth in all business areas . In the Prototyping business , the positive trend in the automotive business should ensure tailwind , while for medical implants and instruments we continue to expect the market will develop in a stable fashion at the high level already achieved in the previous year . As a result of the increased integration of the Medical Technology production sites within the Alphaform Group , an additional impetus to growth is anticipated . For 2011 , the Management Board is retaining its forecast of clearly positive results , providing the general economy and order situation remain at least constant .

"- Group turnover improved from EUR 56 million to EUR 59 million , Currency effects impact results , Forecast confirmed further growth in 2011 annual results Nassau , 12 May 2011 , Leifheit AG presents its report today on the first quarter of 2011 . With an increase of about 5 % the Group again achieved significant growth in turnover , although currency effects impacted consolidated results . Leifheit grew its global turnover from EUR 56 million in Q1 2010 to EUR 59 million , with domestic share rising from 45 % to 47 % . Gross margin improved to 42.9 % ( Q1_2010 42.0 % ) . EBIT was EUR 1.5 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 2.9 million ) . The decrease is primarily due to unrealised currency effects from the measurement of forward foreign exchange contracts which resulted in a loss of EUR 0.6 million , in 2010 the same effects contributed EUR 0.5 million to EBIT . EBT amounted to EUR 1.1 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 2.5 million ) , with results for the period after tax of EUR 0.6 million . Q1_2010 net results after tax for continuing operations amounted to EUR 1.8 million , the Group income statement also benefited from the contribution to results of EUR 1.3 million by the sold Bathroom Furnishings division , so that the results for Q1_2010 totalled EUR 3.1 million . Brand Business and Volume Business growing rapidly As a manufacturer concentrating exclusively on household products , Leifheit divides its business into the segments ` Brand Business ' ( Leifheit , Dr Oetker Bakeware , and Soehnle ) and ` Volume Business ' ( Birambeau , Herby and Project Business ) . Brand Business again reports growth The Leifheit , Dr Oetker Bakeware and Soehnle brands increased turnover by 3 % to EUR 47 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 46 million ) . Growth in the Brand Business again came from the German market , where turnover rose to EUR 26 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 24 million ) . Foreign business continues to reflect the prevailing local economic conditions . Cleaning products continue to be a reliable growth engine in the Brand Business segment , with 9 % growth . The contribution to consolidated operating EBIT ( adjusted for the effects of forward foreign exchange contracts ) was unchanged from the previous year at EUR 1.3 million . Higher distribution costs and foreign exchange losses more than offset the positive trend in margins in Brand Business . Volume Business on the growth track Volume Business increased turnover to EUR 12 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 10 million ) , an increase of 12 % . This is primarily due to business with kitchen goods in the medium price bracket , which showed very high growth , and laundry care also made a significant contribution . Volume Business contributed EUR 0.8 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 1.1 million ) to adjusted operating EBIT , reflecting the impact of higher purchasing prices . EBIT in the previous year also benefitted from one-time government aid in France totalling EUR 0.2 million . Outlook for 2011 strong growth at all levels With its growth in turnover of 5 % in Q1_2011 , Leifheit has proved that the company can follow through on its growth predictions . Now , it is important to utilise further potential in both Brand and Volume Business . The new brand and marketing strategies currently being developed will make a major contribution to this . By year-end Leifheit expects turnover to lay 3-5 % above the 2010 level . However , sharp increases in commodity prices and negative currency effects could significantly reduce the resulting growth in earnings . Assuming a moderate increase in commodity prices , management believes it will be able to report further growth in results , adjusted for currency effects .

"Brilon , May 12 , 2011 the SDAX-listed company CENTROTEC Sustainable AG generated record revenue of EUR 112.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 . Compared with the previous record from one year earlier ( EUR 103.1 million ) , this represents organic growth of 8.9 % . This development was underpinned especially by 13.9 % revenue growth for the largest segment , Climate Systems , to EUR 76.5 million ( previous year EUR 67.2 million ) , which was accompanied by growing market shares and profit margins . The Medical Technology and Engineering Plastics segment , too , bettered the previous revenue record from 2008 with 26.2 % revenue growth to EUR 10.7 million ( previous year EUR 8.5 million ) . Compared with the very strong prior-year quarter , revenue for the Gas Flue Systems segment was down 8.7 % to EUR 25.0 million ( previous year EUR 27.4 million ) , mainly as a result of weaker French business . The operating result for the group is traditionally not particularly meaningful in the first quarter because of the strong seasonal factors at work . Earnings were influenced by shifts in the product mix and by substantial rises in commodity prices over the past few months . The ongoing drive to improve earnings throughout the group , the price adjustments that have been pushed through and the reduced personnel expenses ratio nevertheless compensated in part for this effect . EBITDA of EUR 8.6 million for the first three months of 2011 was consequently only 7.7 % down on the record figure from the previous year ( EUR 9.3 million ) . EBIT reached EUR 4.0 million ( previous year EUR 5.1 million ) . Earnings per share ( EPS ) were down at EUR 0.09 ( previous year EUR 0.19 ) , among other reasons because the investment result was slightly negative , in contrast to the prior-year quarter . For the full year and beyond , the prospects of the CENTROTEC Group have improved further thanks to its stronger market position , the improved environment for energy-saving solutions created by the current energy policy debate , and the general trend in energy prices . In Germany , the financial incentive for solar collectors , heat pumps , biomass boilers and condensing boilers was substantially increased in March . It has also recently been possible to push through noteworthy price increases . Against this backdrop , CENTROTEC confirms the full-year forecast of consolidated revenue amounting to EUR 520 to 535 million and expectations of an operating result ( EBIT ) of EUR 40 to 42 million , which would equate to earnings per share ( EPS ) of EUR 1.70 to 1.80 . Further technologically appropriate acquisitions that fit in with CENTROTEC 's buy and build strategy are moreover conceivable in the remaining part of the year . The steady improvement in the group 's financial situation in recent years gives it the necessary leeway for such moves . The prospect of the company 's first ever distribution of a dividend of EUR 0.10 per share following the Shareholders ' Meeting on May 26 is also to be considered in this context . CENTROTEC Sustainable AG CENTROTEC Sustainable AG and its subsidiaries enjoy a presence in over 50 different countries . The principal group companies are Wolf Heiztechnik , Brink Climate Systems and Ned Air in the Climate Systems segment , which have specialised in heating , climate control and ventilation technology e.g. in the form of solar thermal systems , heat pumps , CHP units , climate control and ventilation systems with heat recovery for residential and commercial buildings , as well as Ubbink and Centrotherm , which have focused on plastic gas flue and air ducting systems and solar system components in the Gas Flue Systems segment .

"Ad-hoc release , 13 May 2011 Solid Start to the Year EADS Reports Results of First Quarter 2011 , Successful market introduction of A320neo , Revenues up 10 percent to EUR 9.9 billion , EBIT * before one-off around EUR 230 million , Free Cash Flow of EUR 0.3 billion , Net Income EUR -12 million , impacted by negative dollar accounting revaluation , Record Net Cash position of EUR 12.2 billion EADS ( stock exchange symbol EAD ) releases encouraging results for the first quarter 2011 while the recovery of the global economy continues to support the growth of passenger traffic . Based on this positive momentum , Airbus is analyzing a further increase in its single aisle production rate which is currently scheduled to increase to 40 aircraft per month by Q1 2012 . A decision is expected shortly . In the first three months of 2011 , the order intake ( 4 ) amounted to EUR 6.3 billion . EADS ' order book of more than EUR 422 billion provides a solid platform for future deliveries . First quarter earnings reflect the usual seasonality pattern in our institutional businesses . Revenues amounted to EUR 9.9 billion . The EBIT * before one-off of around EUR 230 million benefited from good underlying performance on legacy programs and favourable phasing of costs at Airbus Commercial . The reported EBIT * amounted to EUR 192 million . At EUR 12.2 billion , thanks to strong cash-flow management in the first quarter , the Net Cash position remains a key asset to foster future growth . The impacts from events in Japan and North Africa on the commercial aircraft market are expected to be of a temporary nature . These developments are being actively managed , while budget pressures in institutional markets , helicopters and defense and the currency volatility are being monitored . ` Our first quarter financial results reflect a good start to 2011 . The early market success of the A320neo validates the significant prospects we envisage for this program and the acquisition of Vector Aerospace in Canada is a major step forward in expanding our services offering . We also signed the A400M contract amendment , which provides a solid base to further advance this key program ' , said Louis Gallois , CEO of EADS . ` While advancing with the A350 XWB through achieving several critical milestones , this decisive program continues to require our closest attention . ' In the first quarter , EADS ' revenues increased 10 percent to EUR 9.9 billion ( Q1 2010 EUR 9.0 billion ) . This growth is driven primarily by mix effects at Airbus Commercial and Astrium . Deliveries remained at a high level with 119 aircraft at Airbus Commercial , 81 helicopters at Eurocopter and the 42nd consecutive successful Ariane 5 launch . In the first quarter , Airbus Military recorded revenues for the A400M program of EUR 165 million , based on milestones . Series production has started and civil certification is planned for 2011 . On 7 April 2011 , the Customer Nations and EADS concluded the A400M contract amendment negotiations . The contract amendment implements the changes which were agreed in principle by the Customer Nations and EADS on 5 March 2010 . EBIT * before one-off ( adjusted EBIT * ) , an indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding non-recurring charges or profits caused by movements in provisions or foreign exchange impacts , stood at around EUR 230 million ( Q1 2010 around EUR 150 million ) for EADS and at around EUR 160 million for Airbus ( Q1 2010 around EUR 80 million ) . It benefited from good underlying performance in Airbus legacy programs as well as in core business activities in the other Divisions . It also included favourable phasing effects , particularly of non series costs at Airbus Commercial , which should reverse throughout the year and an unchanged A380 impact compared to last year . EADS ' reported EBIT * stood at EUR 192 million ( Q1 2010 EUR 83 million ) . Net Income ( loss ) amounted to EUR -12 million ( Q1 2010 EUR 103 million ) , or earnings per share of EUR -0.01 ( earnings per share Q1 2010 EUR 0.13 ) . The finance result amounts to EUR -197 million ( Q1 2010 EUR 77 million ) . The interest result of EUR -47 million is roughly stable with the 2010 level ( Q1 2010 EUR -53 million ) . Meanwhile , the other financial result deteriorated considerably by EUR 280 million year-on-year . It amounted to EUR -150 million ( Q1 2010 EUR 130 million ) . The main change comes from the negative accounting revaluation of US dollar and British pound ( GBP ) cash assets due to the deterioration of the closing spot rate at the end of March compared to the end of December 2010 . The change in time value of EADS ' hedging options has also led to a negative valuation . On the other hand , the net change in fair value of cash-flow hedges had a positive impact of EUR 1.8 billion on EADS equity . Self-financed Research and Development ( R and D ) expenses increased to EUR 650 million ( Q1 2010 EUR 572 million ) , driven mainly by development on the A350 XWB at Airbus . Free Cash Flow before customer financing improved to EUR 208 million ( Q1 2010 EUR -972 million ) , thanks to better operational performance . The improvement in working capital of EUR 1.2 billion is driven by higher advance payments received , partially reduced by a ramp-up in inventories , particularly at Airbus . The level of capital expenditures increased slightly compared to last year , as expected , as investment continues to ramp-up on the A350 XWB program . Customer financing generated cash of around EUR 100 million in the first quarter as the lessor and banking market appetite continues to gain momentum . Free Cash Flow after customer financing amounted to EUR 309 million ( Q1 2010 EUR -1,124 million ) . EADS ' Net Cash position amounted to EUR 12.2 billion ( year-end 2010 EUR 11.9 billion ) , remaining a solid foundation for the Group 's operational needs as well as future growth . The Group 's order intake ( 4 ) of EUR 6.3 billion was lower than one year ago ( Q1 2010 EUR 14.4 billion ) which included a high level of commercial aircraft orders for the A330 and A350 XWB at Airbus . The First Quarter 2011 order intake is net of 68 commercial aircraft cancellations and conversions . By the end of March 2011 , EADS ' order book ( 4 ) stood at EUR 422.4 billion ( year-end 2010 EUR 448.5 billion ) , providing good visibility for the future . The Airbus Commercial backlog has been reduced by a negative revaluation impact of around EUR 22 billion due to the deterioration of the US dollar closing spot rate since the year-end 2010 . The defense order book is almost stable at EUR 57.0 billion ( year-end 2010 EUR 58.3 billion ) . At the end of March 2011 , EADS ' workforce consisted of 122,899 employees ( year-end 2010 121,691 ) . Outlook EADS confirms its 2011 guidance based on an assumption of EUR 1 = $ 1.35 for the year-end closing spot rate . In 2011 , Airbus should deliver 520 to 530 commercial aircraft and its gross orders should be above its deliveries . EADS ' 2011 revenues should be above the 2010 revenues . EADS expects 2011 EBIT * before one-off to remain stable compared to the 2010 level , at around EUR 1.3 billion . Increasing volume and price improvement at Airbus Commercial are roughly compensated by the deterioration of hedge rates , increasing R and D and less favourable mix of activities at Cassidian . Going forward , reported EBIT * and Earnings Per Share ( EPS ) performance of EADS will be dependent on the Group 's ability to execute on the A400M , A380 and A350 XWB programs , in line with the commitments made to its customers . Reported EBIT * and EPS also depend on exchange rate fluctuations . At EUR 1 = $ 1.35 , EADS expects 2011 EPS to be above the 2010 level of EUR 0.68 . Free Cash Flow is expected to be positive . In 2012 , the Group expects a significant improvement in its EBIT * before one off thanks to higher volume , better pricing and improvement of A380 performance at Airbus . * EADS uses EBIT pre goodwill impairment and exceptionals as a key indicator of its economic performance . The term ` exceptionals ' refers to such items as depreciation expenses of fair value adjustments relating to the EADS merger , the Airbus Combination and the formation of MBDA , as well as impairment charges thereon . EADS is a global leader in aerospace , defense and related services . In 2010 , the Group , comprising Airbus , Astrium , Cassidian and Eurocopter , generated revenues of EUR 45.8 billion and employed a workforce of nearly 122,000 .",5.844601,5.532991,True,True
"Preliminary figures for the first two quarters of 2010_2011 Ad-hoc Announcement pursuant to Article 15 of the German Securities Trading Act ( WpHG ) SANOCHEMIA confirms the turnaround and returns to profitability , Sustainable turnaround achieved , EBIT in the first half of the financial year over EUR 1.5 million , EBITDA EUR 3.5 million , Focus on swift market expansion Vienna , 13 May 2011 Sanochemia Pharmazeutika AG , Vienna , has confirmed the turnaround that could be seen in the previous year with convincing operating results in the first half of 2010_2011 and returned to profitability . The company , which is listed in the General Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange ( ISIN AT0000776307 ) and in Vienna , was able to increase its turnover to more than EUR 16 million , as well as raising the operating EBIT twenty-fold to more than EUR 1.5 million ( EUR 0.07 m in the prior year ) , this represents the best operating result in five years . After a positive start to the business year ( Q1 as at 31.12.2010 ) , this positive trend is a clear indication that the company has been able to steer its way back to long-term profitability . Key factors which have contributed to this success include the implementation of a strict cost management policy , ongoing process improvements , and results-oriented sales activities throughout the entire Company . As a result , Sanochemia expects to achieve positive earnings for the entire 2010_2011 business year . At over EUR 16 million ( prior year EUR 13.7 m ) , revenue rose by around 20 percent year-on-year , with the main contributors to this increase being radiological products and considerably higher synthesis performance . Consolidating Alvetra and Werfft GmbH for the first time made a contribution of around ten percent to both turnover and EBIT . The acquisition of Alvetra means that the company now has four additional subsidiaries in key CEE countries and it will also be able to reap future benefits with synergies in both administrative and production areas . Capital increase May 2011 The Company 's focus is squarely on the global expansion of both radiological products and Tolperison . The inflow of funds from the capital increase ( April 2011 ) have enabled the Company to intensify its involvement in the market . With a continuously increasing product range , existing authorisations in more than 40 countries and attractive partnerships , the company will be able to enjoy considerable growth in terms of turnover and results with corresponding investment in the coming years . The planned clinical phase IIb trial for the very promising up-and-coming product Vidon ( PVP hypericin ) , Sanochemia 's bladder cancer diagnostic , will be financed from the operating cashflow and is set to begin in June . The Company 's equity ratio is currently 63 % and is due to gradually increase to 70 % in order to be able to respond to market trends in a more independent and flexible manner . High volume of export orders Radiology-related exports continued to exhibit strong growth , with an increase of 25 percent . The reason for this considerable improvement in order volumes compared to the previous year is due to large orders from the so-called ` pharmerging markets ' . Sanochemia has gained a foothold in a number of new markets with enormous potential , most notably Russia and Iran . However , markets in Spain , Egypt and the Gulf countries are showing considerable promise . Current orders for Scanlux , the x-ray contrast agent , placed by these countries amount to approximately five million euros and will be partly delivered in 2011 . In the medium term , it is expected that these markets will double in size provided that additional radiological products receive marketing authorisation , such as Sanochemia 's MR contrast agents . The complete financial statements , including segment reporting , for the first half of the 2010_2011 business year will be published on 24 May 2011 and will be available on the website . Sanochemia will hold a conference call for journalists and analysts on 24 May 2011 at 10 30 am . The number to be dialled will be announced at short notice .

"Munich , 13 May 2011 , The migration of the German logistics center from Stauffenberg to the new national and international main logistics hub in HÃ rselgau_Eisenach has incurred higher costs than initially anticipated by zooplus AG . In view of these developments , the Management Board is expecting a one-off impact in the first two quarters of 2011 and is therefore adjusting its earnings forecast from breakeven to slightly positive to a net loss in the low single digit million region . This move follows expected one-off costs of EUR 4 million , which were initially budgeted to total EUR 1.5 mm only . The migration of logistics will likely be completed by the third quarter 2011 and will not have any further significant impacts on earnings in the third and fourth quarter 2011 . While the migration process has resulted in direct and indirect costs , customer business continues to develop as planned , however . As a result , the Management Board has confirmed its total sales forecast of over EUR 250 mm for the full year 2011 and over EUR 320 mm for 2012 . The new central logistics site in HÃ rselgau_Eisenach is a vital element in the further planned growth of the company and will boost the logistics capacity of zooplus from EUR 300 mm to over EUR 400 mm . Most of the additional expenses stem from higher costs for the initial implementation of the new site , temporary storage and moving costs as well as the temporary use of buffer sites both domestically and abroad . The new larger site in HÃ rselgau replaced the now phased out German logistics facility in Stauffenberg in April 2011 . The company is expecting the new site to be at full operating efficiency levels during the second half of the year . Contact",-4.889435,-3.738744,False,False

"Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Section 15 WpHG ( Securities Trading Act ) Figures for the first three months of 2011 ( 1.1 . , 31.03.11 ) CTS EVENTIM Ticketing boom continues in 2011 Ticketing segment boosts revenue by 35.9 % to EUR 54.8 million _ Internet ticketing volume rises around 24 % to 4.8 million tickets _ Around 106 million visitors to EVENTIM web portals _ Revenue in Live Entertainment segment lower as expected , at EUR 48.2 million , than in record year 2010 _ Group achieves EUR 101.0 million in total revenue and a normalised EBITDA of EUR 23.6 million _ Positive revenue and earning outlook for year as a whole Munich , 16.05.2011 . CTS EVENTIM AG , listed in the SDAX index ( ISIN DE0005470306 ) , proved its unique position in the European ticketing market once again in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 . Revenue was boosted 35.9 % to EUR 54.8 million in the Ticketing segment . The highly profitable Internet business , especially , continues to grow at a double-digit rate around 106 million people visited the EVENTIM portals in Q1 ( prior year 87 million ) , ordering 4.8 million tickets in total , a year-on-year increase of around 24 % . The Live Entertainment segment , in contrast , was unable to beat the record set the previous year , also due to the scheduled reduction in revenue following the deconsolidation of the FKP Scorpio Group since 1 July 2010 , and recorded a decline in revenue and EBIT . The ticketing business for music , cultural and sports events proved to be exceedingly robust and sustainable , even in the recent years of the economic and financial crisis . For the current 2011 business year also , the Management Board expects the Group to progress well and to achieve yet another improvement in revenue and earnings . In the period from 1 January to 31 March 2011 , the CTS Group generated EUR 101.0 million in revenue ( Q1_2010 EUR 127.8 million , down 21.0 % ) , a normalised EBITDA of EUR 23.6 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 25.6 million , down 8.0 % ) and a normalised EBIT before amortisation from purchase price allocation ( Ticketcorner Holding AG and See Tickets Germany GmbH ) of EUR 20.7 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 23.4 million , down 11.7 % ) . Due to the acquisition of See Tickets Germany GmbH , and the pending arbitration proceedings against Live Nation , the operating profit is temporarily reduced by personnel restructuring and legal consultancy expenses . After these non-recurring items , the EBITDA figure amounts to EUR 20.2 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 25.1 million , down 19.6 % ) , while the EBIT amounts to EUR 14.5 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 22.7 million , down 36.2 % ) . In the Ticketing segment , organic growth in the core European markets and a number of successful acquisitions resulted in a substantial 35.9 % increase in revenue to EUR 54.8 million before consolidation between the segments , compared to EUR 40.3 million in Q1_2010 . CTS EVENTIM sold 4.8 million tickets via the Internet alone in the period under review , a year-on-year increase of around 24 % ( Q1_2010 3.9 million ) . Around 106 million visits to the EVENTIM web portals were logged ( Q1_2010 87 million ) . The impacts of the aforementioned non-recurring items were confined to the Ticketing segment . The normalised EBITDA was up 27.6 % at EUR 18.6 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 14.6 million ) , while normalised EBIT before amortisation from purchase price allocation was up 25.1 % at EUR 16.3 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 13.0 million ) . After these non-recurring items , EBITDA was 8.3 % higher at EUR 15.3 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 14.1 million ) , while EBIT decreased 18.1 % to EUR 10.0 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 12.3 million ) . In the Live Entertainment segment , as expected , the first quarter of 2011 did not achieve the quarterly record set in 2010 . The main reasons for the unusual success of the segment last year were the large number of highly successful tours and events . The deconsolidation of the FKP Scorpio Group , in conjunction with the acquisition of See Tickets Germany GmbH , also had a negative impact on revenue and earnings as expected . This explains why revenue in the first quarter of 2011 totalled only EUR 48.2 million ( Q1_2010 EUR 89.1 million , down 45.9 % ) .

"- CEO Dr. Christoph Wolff In the future we want to offer solutions for all areas of solar energy and , in doing so , further expand our technology base , Solar-thermal power plants remain the essence of the brand and the focus of activities , Numerous synergy effects expected for project development , financing and power plant construction Solar Millennium AG ( ISIN DE0007218406 ) is expanding its solar strategy and , in doing so , broadening its technology base . As CEO Dr. Christoph Wolff mentioned at today 's Annual Shareholder Meeting in Erlangen , the Company intends to generate synergy effects by building not only parabolic trough power plants , but also applying other technologies for the use of solar energy in major power plants around the world in the future . The essence of the brand and the focus of activities will remain on solar-thermal power plants , in particular those based on the parabolic trough technology . Photovoltaics are to be additionally used in individual projects . This will allow the team 's expertise in the business fields of Project Development and Financing as well as Construction to be used even more extensively and efficiently . In the case of solar-thermal power plants , mirrors concentrate the solar radiation and thereby generate the heat energy used to create electricity . The major advantage of this technology lies in the fact that the heat energy can be stored in an inexpensive and efficient manner , thus allowing electricity to be supplied reliably on demand , even after sunset . While Solar Millennium specializes in parabolic trough power plants and holds a leading position here , the Company intends to use technologies other than parabolic troughs , for example solar tower power plants , in the medium to long term Solar Millennium began establishing its own research and development team last year aimed at the marketable development of solar tower power plants . In addition , the Company is pursuing the use of photovoltaics , especially in combination with parabolic trough plants , in order to better utilize the potential of power plant surfaces . Dr. Christoph Wolff , CEO of Solar Millennium AG ` The expertise in project development , solar data measurement and approval processes can be used in equal measure for all power plant technologies . These synergy effects allow us to better utilize the capacities of our teams in the scope of our business model and increase the number of our potential power plant locations . ' Project locations not suitable for one type of technology due to their size , qualities or other general conditions can therefore still be used by Solar Millennium by applying other technologies to generate solar power . While parabolic trough power plants have been in use for years and Solar Millennium realizes plants using this technology in Egypt , Spain and the US , there is still a need for development when it comes to solar tower power plants . With parabolic trough plants , the solar radiation is concentrated in long parabolically curved rows of mirrors onto a pipe in the focal line of the collector . In the case of solar towers , several sun-tracking biaxial mirrors , or so-called heliostats , concentrate the solar radiation onto a central receiver at the top of a tower . How the various technologies are used in the future will depend on the purpose , the characteristics of the location and the general conditions of each respective market . On surfaces less suitable for solar-thermal power plants due to their composition or lack in size , Solar Millennium wants to turn to photovoltaics in the future , above all as a supplement to parabolic trough plants for the commercial use of uneven terrain or border areas of the project locations . The existing knowhow of the teams working in project development , financing and power plant construction can also be used for this technology . Depending on the project , the Company plans to cooperate with experienced photovoltaic partners , the cells are to be purchased on the global market . Dr. Wolff explains the strategic orientation ` Solar power has the greatest potential of all renewable energy sources and requires the least surface area per kilowatt hour generated . The name Solar Millennium today stands for the successful development and realization of large-scale solar power plants . They now allow for the sustainable supply of electricity to large cities and industry at the same level of output as nuclear power plants . We hope to continue down this path of success and to expand using additional solar technologies . Solar power therefore enjoys priority in all investment decisions of project development as well as in our research and development plans . '",1.031744,1.595151,True,True

The interim report published today shows revenues of EUR 3.2 million for the first , traditionally weakest quarter of the year , compared with EUR 4.8 million in the same period of the previous year . Postponed and canceled projects had an additional negative impact on revenues . Despite reduced costs , the key earnings figures also reflected this development EBITDA amounted to EUR -1.5 million after EUR -0.9 million in the previous year , while EBIT declined from EUR -1.8 million to EUR -2.1 million . At EUR -2.1 million , earnings before taxes ( EBT ) were essentially unchanged as against the prior-year figure of EUR -2.0 million . At the reporting date 31 March 2011 , total assets amounted to EUR 12.2 million ( 31 December 2010 EUR 12.8 million ) . Equity amounted to EUR 3.82 million compared with EUR 6.15 million as of 31 December 2010 ( reduction due to spin-off of Outside Broadcast operations ) . As a result , the equity ratio also declined to 31 % ( 31 December 2010 48 % ) . Cash and cash equivalents totalled EUR 0.8 million compared with EUR 1.5 million at year-end 2010 . The fact that the first quarter has limited information value with regard to the year as a whole , the strong order backlog for the second quarter and the good strategic and operational positioning of WIGE MEDIA AG provide grounds for optimism as to the course of business for the rest of the year . WIGE MEDIA AG expects to record a further increase in operating earnings , not least as a result of the restructuring measures taking full effect and the external growth potential arising from the expected consolidation within the media industry .

"DGAP-Adhoc Positive results from atrial fibrillation study Notice pursuant to Â 15 WpHG ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz , German Securities Trading Law ) by DGAP , a subsidiary of Equity Story AG . The issuer is solely responsible for the contents of the notice . Clinical Trial Confirms Application of SRAclinic for Stroke Prevention , Prospective trial at the university hospital Heidelberg considering the application of SRAclinic in stroke units shows convincing results . , Fully automated SRAclinic from apoplex medical technologies for the detection of atrial fibrillation after stroke is superior to current diagnostic procedures and could help to prevent future strokes . Apoplex medical technologies , Pirmasens , Geratherm Medical AG , Geschwenda May 26th , 2011 . To prevent secondary strokes , it is of utmost importance to know the etiology of a stroke . Against this background , Prof. Dr. med . Roland Veltkamp presented today the up to date unpublished results of his prospective clinical trial for the ` detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at a stroke unit ' . The presentation was given during the 20th European Stroke Conference ( ESC ) at Hamburg ( Germany ) . The trial was conducted from March 2010 to January 2011 at the stroke unit of the university hospital Heidelberg and included app . 600 patients . It compared the detection of atrial fibrillation under the application of SRAclinic ( SRA = Stroke Risk Analysis ) with the conventional procedure . Atrial fibrillation is considered as the most important risk factor for stroke . SRAclinic is a fully automated ECG analysis for the detection of atrial fibrillation . It was developed by apoplex medical technologies GmbH from Pirmasens and is on the market . Convincing trial results The trial shows a significant superiority of SRAclinic in the detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation over conventional examination methods like 24 hour long term ECG or continuous ECG monitoring without automated analysis . A significant increase of the detection rate for patients with atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke or TIA ( transient ischemic attack ) was reached with the application of SRAclinic . In total , 9.2 percent of the stroke patients were found with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during their stay at the stroke unit . With a combination of the admission ECG and the automated analysis of the ECG data from monitoring , 96.2 percent of the patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were found . On the contrary , the more elaborate conventional 24 hour long term ECG in combination with the admission ECG detected only 58.5 percent of the patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . As SRAclinic is using routine monitoring ECG data from the stroke unit anyway , it saves diagnostic resources . Background to SRAclinic SRAclinic is used in stroke units , which are special units for the treatment of stroke patients . The analysis of the ECG data is based on a patented mathematical procedure which interprets changes in the heart rate dynamics that occur in connection with atrial fibrillation . SRAclinic uses the routine ECG data from the patient monitoring system . Strong Potentials ` The results of the trial and the strong potential of the method surprised us ' , said Prof. Dr. med . Roland Veltkamp , Neurologist at the university hospital Heidelberg , after his talk at the ESC . ` Although doctors and nurses at our big stroke unit in Heidelberg are well aware of the importance of the documentation of atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke for prevention of secondary strokes , the application of the automated analysis lead to a significant increase of newly detected patients with atrial fibrillation compared to the conventional ECG monitoring . Therefore the system could make an important contribution to the prevention of secondary strokes . ' Supplementary information about apoplex medical technologies apoplex medical technologies GmbH was founded in 2004 in Pirmasens , in the west of the Rhineland-Palatinate , and , within the field of medical technology , specializes in new and innovative technological products for the prevention of strokes throughout the world . The subsidiary of Geratherm Medical AG focuses on easily applicable and efficient methods of patient screening using medical-technical applications to prevent strokes and vascular dementia . The SRA ( Stroke Risk Analysis ) procedure is the first practicable screening method for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . It is available in versions for use in medical practices and stroke units . apoplex medical technologies is supported by an extensive academic and clinical network , which professionally supplements its own core competences in the fields of mathematics , physics and medicine .",1.162505,1.252511,True,True

"DÃ 1/4 sseldorf _ Pfullendorf , May 30 , 2011 , ALNO AG has today published its financial figures for the past 2010 financial year and for the first quarter of 2011 . In terms of EBIT before restructuring items , the Group reported a marked improvement from EUR -24.2 million in 2009 to EUR -2.2 million in 2010 . As a consequence , the company achieved the forecast that the Managing Board issued last April of improving the operating result before restructuring costs . Following a positive EBIT before restructuring items in the first half-year , a negative result of EUR 3.7 million in the second half-year prevented a better overall result . Earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) fell from EUR 17.3 million in 2009 to EUR 1.0 million in 2010 . The operating result ( EBIT ) improved from EUR -22.9 million in 2009 to EUR -11.1 million in 2010 . ALNO AG reduced its consolidated net loss from EUR -39.0 million in 2009 to EUR -13.1 million in 2010 . Full-year revenue stood at EUR 467.3 million , representing a 5.3 % reduction compared with EUR 493.4 million in 2009 . As part of the repositioning and product range streamlining , the management also consciously refrained from entering into low-margin revenues in the first half of 2010 . This effect was also still evident in the third quarter since agreements on higher prices that the company entered into with important major customers did not take effect until August . The first positive effects arising from the new price structures are anticipated in the second quarter of 2011 . Particularly in the fourth quarter of 2010 , there were also negative effects from start-up problems in the production of the new WELLMANN product range at the Enger site . In addition , export business put the brakes on sales growth in 2010 due to the continued real estate crisis in Southern Europe and the UK . In the first quarter of the current year , revenue was down to EUR 108.7 million , compared with EUR 114.7 million in the comparable prior-year period , reflecting a 5.2 % fall . In this quarter , too , start-up problems with the new WELLMANN product range exerted a negative impact on revenue . This burdening factor is currently being resolved . As part of the planned lower revenue base at the start of the year , EBITDA in the first quarter of 2011 fell to EUR -4.8 million , compared with EUR 1.9 million in the previous year . The operating loss ( EBIT ) also worsened from EUR -0.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 to EUR -7.5 million in the first quarter of the current year . For the full 2011 year , the Managing Board of ALNO AG expects that EBITDA will increase compared with 2011 .",-0.3982329,0.6368479,True,True

"Press Release Orascom Development Q1 2011 results , Ongoing solid real estate pre-sales , Operational profit with an EBITDA margin of 10 % despite significant turmoil in its biggest market Egypt , Sound financial position Financial results of Orascom Development for the period ending 31 March 2011 were heavily impacted by the political turmoil in Egypt while the performance in other destinations was solid . Overall , Orascom Development was able to withstand this unprecedented situation and the Group 's business model proved its resilience . Total turnover decreased by 55 % from CHF 117 million to CHF 53 million and the net profit ( after non-controlling interests ) by 98 % from CHF 26 million to CHF 0.6 million . The operating profit margin fell from 48 % to 10 % . Hotel revenues dropped by 40 % to CHF 28 million as occupancy rates in Egypt fell to 42 % following the political unrest . Real estate and construction revenues decreased by 71 % from CHF 44 million to CHF 13 million , because construction activities in Egypt have been halted for 50 days and no revenues were recognized during this timeframe . However , at CHF 26 million real estate pre-sales excluding basic affordable housing were above the previous year level and confirm the Group 's ability to increase pre-sales in its new destinations . First quarter results are not indicative for full-year 2011 . In the last weeks , the political situation in Egypt has recovered , leading to better occupancy rates in Egyptian hotels and real estate construction activities have picked-up . Furthermore , the second half of the year is usually much stronger for Orascom Development . Altdorf_Cairo , 6 June 2011 , In Q1 2001 , the Orascom Development Holding AG ( Orascom Development ) was materially impacted by the Egyptian revolution , as many businesses came to a near stand-still for nearly 50 days . Despite ongoing diversification , Egypt remains the biggest single market for the Group and therefore the impact on overall results was significant . However , operations outside Egypt performed in line with expectations in both hotels and real estate and the projects under construction in Oman , Switzerland and Morocco made good progress . Overall , the Group was able to manage the effects of the unprecedented crisis situation in its home market and protect its businesses successfully as highlighted by a positive operating result whilst maintaining a sound financial position . Total consolidated revenues declined by 55 % from CHF 117 million for the same period last year to CHF 53 million , due to the events in Egypt and the deconsolidation of the Tours Operations activities in the second half of 2010 . Gross profit dropped by 89 % from CHF 37 million to CHF 4 million and the profit for the period ( after non-controlling interests ) decreased from CHF 26 million to CHF 0.6 million . The EBITDA margin moved down from 48 % in Q1 2010 to 10 % in Q1 2011 . Improved hotel performance outside Egypt Revenues in the hotel segment decreased by 40 % from CHF 46 million to CHF 28 million and amounted for 53 % of the Group 's sales in the period under review . Tourism in Egypt was significantly impacted by the issuance of security warnings and travel bans following the turmoil that started in January 2011 . As a consequence , occupancy rates in our Egyptian destinations fell from 71 % in Q1 2010 to 42 % in Q1 2011 while Average Room Rates fell from CHF 55 to CHF 48 . On the other hand , hotel operations in the U.A.E. and in Jordan improved with an occupancy rate of 77 % , up from 58 % a year earlier . Shortly after the end of the reporting period , occupancy rates in Egypt have improved gradually following the removal of most travel bans to Egypt . However , the number of flight connections remains subdued because capacities have been shifted to other destinations and these will only be re-allocated to Egypt over time . Real estate pre-sales remain on solid level Real estate and construction revenues accounted for 24 % of total Group sales . Segment turnover was at CHF 13 million , 71 % below last year 's level of CHF 44 million , mainly due to the events in Egypt . Because construction activities in Egypt had to be halted for almost 50 days , planned real estate and construction revenues in the amount of approximately CHF 33 million ( resulting from pre-sold units being under construction ) had to be postponed . Furthermore , real estate reservations in the amount of CHF 50 million were not booked yet as part of contracted units because of administrative delays . These pre-sales will be booked in Q2 2011 . The total value of contracted units that could be considered in Q1 2011 amounted to CHF 27 million in comparison to CHF 31 million last year . It is important to note that , despite the administrative delays , the value of contracted units excluding basic affordable housing was above the previous year 's performance ( CHF 26.10 million vs. CHF 25.65 million ) while the average selling price surged by more than 60 % . This reflects the balanced and diversified real estate portfolio of Orascom Development as well as the fact that the destinations outside Egypt are becoming more important and offer protection against unfavourable developments in Egypt . Sound financial base With an equity ratio of 57 % , Orascom Development continues to operate on a solid capital base . The cash position of CHF 241 million will allow for future investments in order to advance the numerous projects of the Group . Outlook full-year 2011 In consideration of the special situation in Egypt and the seasonality in the company 's business , first quarter results should not be indicative of 2011 full-year performance . The third and fourth quarters are normally the most important contributors to top line revenues as well as the bottom line . Nevertheless , the turmoil in Egypt and the Arab world reduced visibility of the business in the region . The expansion of our international activities will advance without interruption and real estate pre-sales are expected to remain on a good level . Orascom Development estimates that the diversification of its revenues across different geographical areas will continue and thereby broaden its operations . Sales target in Andermatt for 2011 remains unchanged at CHF 120 million .",-0.7636979,0.05273673,True,True

"Acting on the authorisation provided by the Annual General Meeting on 26 August 2010 , Heliad Equity Partners ( ISIN DE000A0L1NN5 ) will be buying back a total of up to ten percent of the company 's share capital , corresponding to up to 1,214,580 individual registered shares . This was decided by the management of the general partner and the company 's Supervisory Board yesterday evening and this morning . To date the company holds 874,500 treasury stock shares . A total of up to 340,080 shares are therefore still available for further acquisition . After achieving the 10 percent range , the Management Board intends to propose a withdrawal of the own shares to the Supervisory Board , whereby the number of the outstanding shares would decrease accordingly . Given that currently Heliad 's share is quoted far below its NAV of EUR 6.03 , a share buyback following a withdrawal is an appropriate way within the interest of all shareholders to increase the asset value per share . The share buyback is to be executed in the coming weeks via the stock exchange . Consistent with the authorisation provided by the Annual General Meeting , the purchase price per share paid by Heliad when acquiring shares via the stock exchange may not exceed or fall short of the share 's average closing price in Xetra trading in the respective three stock market trading days preceding acquisition by more than ten percent . According to the resolution adopted by the general partner and the Supervisory Board , the share buyback should be managed by a financial institution that is independent and not influenced by Heliad in terms of its decisions concerning the timing of individual buyback transactions .",3.107573,3.183046,True,True

"On 7 June 2011 , Deutsche BÃ rse AG , SIX Group AG and SIX Swiss Exchange AG signed a definitive agreement for a transaction which would make Deutsche BÃ rse the sole owner of the currently jointly owned Eurex Group and SIX Group a shareholder in the combined Deutsche BÃ rse and NYSE Euronext entity . The agreement is still subject to the formal approval of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Boerse AG and also , based on the Business Combination Agreement , the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext , both approvals are scheduled for June 16 , 2011 . The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Boerse AG and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of NYSE Euronext , following discussions within their Boards , expressed their support for the transaction . The timing of the transaction is generally driven by the closing of the pending Deutsche BÃ rse and NYSE Euronext combination . Under the agreement Deutsche BÃ rse would receive 100 % of all Eurex sales and profits instead of the 85 % reflected in the consolidated accounts of Deutsche BÃ rse Group today after closing of the transaction with economic effect as of 1 January 2012 . In return , SIX Swiss Exchange AG would receive a consideration of EUR295 million in cash and EUR295 million in shares of the combined Deutsche BÃ rse and NYSE Euronext entity . The shares of the combined entity will be shares held by Deutsche BÃ rse as the result of the tender of Deutsche BÃ rse treasury shares into shares of the combined entity . The financial terms reflect an agreement relating to the resolution of all rights and obligations of both parties under the current contractual framework of Eurex and its existing 2014 termination provisions . As a result of the agreement with SIX Group AG and SIX Swiss Exchange AG , Deutsche BÃ rse expects an immediate net income accretion after closing of the transaction , which is anticipated in 2012 . On a pro forma basis for the first quarter 2011 the transaction would have resulted in EUR26 .1 million incremental sales revenue , EUR17 .4 million additional EBIT , and a EUR15 .0 million higher net income . The net income number includes a preliminary assumption of a EUR2 .5 million potential quarterly amortization charge which is still subject to an assessment of the purchase price allocation . Closing of the transaction will occur after consummation of the Deutsche BÃ rse and NYSE Euronext transaction which is expected for year-end 2011 . However , the definitive agreement between SIX Group AG , SIX Swiss Exchange AG and Deutsche BÃ rse AG is not contingent on the consummation of the Deutsche BÃ rse and NYSE Euronext combination . Under the terms of the agreement , Deutsche BÃ rse AG will indirectly purchase the 50 percent stake of SIX Swiss Exchange AG in Eurex Zurich AG . At the same time , the contractual arrangements resulting in an entitlement of 15 % of economic benefits of Eurex to SIX Swiss Exchange AG will be terminated . As a result Deutsche BÃ rse will become the sole shareholder of Eurex Zurich AG and thereby the sole shareholder of Eurex Group . Further , Deutsche BÃ rse will have exclusive rights to the Eurex brand and Eurex software . The transaction also comprises the indirect participation of SIX Group in International Securities Exchange Holdings , Inc. , Direct Edge Holdings , LLC and European Energy Exchange AG .

Time to ACR20 response was significantly ( p-value smaller than 0.05 ) shorter in the vidofludimus group compared to placebo ( median 56 days vs. 92 days ) . The patient group treated with vidofludimus also reported higher ACR50 ( 25.8 % vs. 17.2 % ) and ACR70 ( 12.5 % vs. 6 % ) response rates compared to placebo at week 13 .

In particular , there were no relevant increases of diarrhea , neutropenia , anemia , hypertension , cholesterol or liver enzyme levels . Only one serious adverse event was reported in the vidofludimus group which was judged as not related to vidofludimus . No deaths occurred .

Extension_Exploration Drilling Program Highlights from of the new assay results ( uncut average gold grades in g_t , true widths , unless indicated by an asterisk ) , include the following intercepts ( all RC holes ) * 22.8 m at 1.3 g_t in drill hole 2011-122 ( Extension Drilling ) * 9.1 m at 1.6 g_t in 2011-127 ( Extension Drilling ) * 6.1 m at 2.0 g_t in 2011-143 ( Extension Drilling ) * 13.7 m at 1.3 g_t in GEMR-005 ( Exploration Drilling - North Gemfield ) * 15.2 m at 2.4 g_t in GEMR-008 ( Exploration Drilling - North Gemfield ) * 18.3 m at 2.3 g_t in KEN-003 ( Exploration Drilling - Kendall ) * ( * True width can not yet be estimated ) The Exploration Drilling program has been focused to the north and northeast of the Gemfield deposit ( see map in Appendix 2 ) , at the Gemfield North , Kendall and Tailings areas ( the latter so-called due to the presence on surface of mill tailings from historical production , which are not currently being evaluated by IMZ ) . The Extension Drilling program is currently entirely focused on the Goldfield Main deposit ( see map in Appendix 1 ) , where both RC and core drilling is targeted at upgrading and extending the existing gold resource . Goldfield Project NI 43101 Mineral Resources The Goldfield project hosts three known gold resources , Goldfield Main , Gemfield and McMahon Ridge . The current estimated mineral resources for the overall Goldfield project are . * 1,247,000 ounces of Measured and Indicated resources , contained in 31.3 million tonnes ( ` Mt ' ) at an average grade of 1.2 g_t goldÍ 3/4 and * 385,000 ounces of Inferred resources , contained in 7.7 Mt at an average grade of 1.6 g_t gold . The gold cut-off grades used were 0.34 g_t for Gemfield and McMahon Ridge and 0.4 g_t for Goldfield Main . Mineral resource estimates at the Goldfield project have been conducted separately for the Goldfield Main deposit and the Gemfield_McMahon Ridge deposits . * at Goldfield Main , the mineral resources were estimated in 2011 by Qualified Person ( ` QP ' ) R. Mohan Srivastava P. Geo ( see IMZ press release dated February 1st , 2011 ) . * at Gemfield and McMahon Ridge , the mineral resources were estimated in 2005 by Watts , Griffis and McOuat , with John R. Sullivan , P. Geo as the QP . Metallurgical and QAQC Twin hole drilling IMZ drilled core holes at Gemfield and McMahon Ridge to acquire sufficient samples to conduct feasibility - level metallurgical testwork to evaluate both a heap leach recovery scenario and an agitation leach processing option . It is important to note that the metallurgical drill holes have been designed to optimize the amount of mineralized material and so are typically drilled down the dip of ( i.e. parallel to ) the mineralized zones and are all drilled into areas of known mineralization . Accordingly the drill results may not be representative of the mineralization generally found at Gemfield and McMahon Ridge . The twin ( or duplicate ) drill hole QAQC ( Quality Assessment_Quality Control ) program has been designed to confirm not only that samples generated from RC drilling in the presence of old workings are reliable but also that historical data are reliable from drill campaigns with limited verifiable supporting data . These twin holes have intentionally targeted areas of better-than-average grade from previous drill holes . Highlights of the Metallurgical and Twin-hole Core Drilling Programs are shown below ( uncut grades , drill intercepts are not reflective of true width ) * 30.49 m at 51.15 g_t in MCM-005C ( Metallurgical ) * 48.78 m at 23.7 g_t in GEM-002C ( Metallurgical ) * 35.82 m at 9.15 g_t in MCM-005C ( Metallurgical ) * 52.29 m at 9.13 g_t in MCM-004C ( Metallurgical ) * 7.93 m at 11.37 g_t in MCM-002C ( Metallurgical ) * 12.2 m at 3.77 g_t in GMD-004C ( Twin ) * 6.1 m at 7.33 g_t in MCM-003C ( Metallurgical ) * 13.66 m at 2.96 g_t in MCM-003C ( Metallurgical ) Sample intervals are currently being selected for the metallurgical testwork and final results from the column leach tests are not expected until the fourth quarter of this year . The results of the twin-hole program will be reviewed in detail and used in support of an updated mineral resource estimate for Goldfield Main expected to be published before the end of the year . Environmental Baseline Studies As an integral part of the planned feasibility study at Goldfield , scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2012 , an environmental baseline study has also commenced , with the following components currently in progress . * Hydrogeological characterization program , drilling , installation and development of groundwater monitoring wells at the three deposits , to be followed by hydraulic testing , monitoring and modeling of groundwater quantity and quality . * Geochemical characterization program , acid base accounting ( ABA ) testing of samples from representative waste rock locations . This work complements previous studies by previous property owner , Metallic Ventures , relating to hydrology , biological and cultural resources , and waste rock characterization .",1.445462,1.933306,True,True
"Ad-hoc release pursuant to Â 15 Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ( German Securities Trading Act ) WILEX reports on the Pre-BLA Meeting with the FDA and the next steps in the REDECTANE ( R ) approval process Munich , Germany , 17 June 2011 . WILEX AG ( ISIN DE0006614720 _ WL6 _ Frankfurt Stock Exchange ) today announced that the Pre-BLA Meeting with the American Food and Drug Administration planned for the second quarter has taken place . The aim of this type of meeting is to discuss the application for approval and the approval process for a product in advance of filing . Two issues remain to be resolved by WILEX and its partner Ion Beam Applications SA , Louvain-la-Neuve , Belgium ( IBA Reuters IBAB . BR and Bloomberg IBAB . BB ) . During the pre-BLA discussions the FDA confirmed that the trial provides reasonable evidence for the diagnostic efficacy and safety of REDECTANE ( R ) and stated that three hypotheses were confirmed . In order to strengthen the position for approval , the FDA suggested that WILEX and IBA might consider an outcomes based study to provide additional evidence of clinical benefit before BLA filing . Such an outcomes based study demands that a doctor determines patient management based on the diagnostic result with REDECTANE ( R ) and PET_CT . During the Phase III REDECT trial , and in accordance with the trial design agreed in the SPA , doctors did not utilise the REDECTANE ( R ) PET_CT results to influence the decision for or against surgery . For the completed Phase III trial , the diagnostic results of CT or PET_CT had to be confirmed by an histological analysis post-surgery under the terms of the trial design . WILEX and IBA agree with the FDA that a trial with a clinical benefit outcome could represent the next logical step in REDECTANE 's development . WILEX , IBA and external medical advisors however are of the opinion that such a trial should be conducted as a Phase IV trial after market approval . WILEX and IBA will first discuss the trial design and strategy with the Medical Advisory Board and subsequently with the FDA . Following agreement a further announcement will be made . The second issue discussed with the FDA concerns the manufacturing of REDECTANE ( R ) . WILEX has successfully completed two consecutive consistency lots for process validation of the naked antibody Girentuximab at the manufacturer Avid Bioservices , Inc. , Tustin , CA , USA . The third production run was started before the pre-BLA meeting and will be completed shortly . Process validation data from this third run were to be submitted to the FDA by WILEX during the approval process . The FDA has made clear that all necessary process validation data from all three consistency lots must be delivered as part of BLA filing . Furthermore , the FDA has requested from IBA ( responsible for radioactive labeling of the antibody ) data pertaining to the commercial production of REDECTANE ( R ) , in particular product characterisation and process validation . By building a new manufacturing facility with central manufacturing and quality assurance , IBA has created an infrastructure in which REDECTANE ( R ) can be produced not only as study medication but also as a marketable product . WILEX and IBA will provide the FDA with the necessary data in the next few months .

"* Sales forecast increased * EBITDA and EBIT forecasts lowered ZÃ rbig_Leipzig , 22 June 2011 , Due to weak sales of bioethanol , VERBIO Vereinigte BioEnergie AG is reducing its results guidance for financial year 2011 . The sales contribution will increase to between EUR 650 million and EUR 750 million . The company expects sales in the EUR 650 million to EUR 750 million range , to generate EBITDA of between EUR 25 million and EUR 30 million and EBIT of between EUR 6 million and EUR 12 million in financial year 2011 . At the beginning of the financial year , the company had set a target of between EUR 35 million and EUR 40 million for EBITDA and EBIT of between EUR 15 million and EUR 20 million . One of the assumptions was that bioethanol sales would remain at least at the level of the previous year . Due to the sluggish implementation of E10 fuel the demand of the petroleum companies in the second quarter 2011 was significantly less than originally planned , resulting in a bioethanol capacity utilisation of nearly 50 per cent . In the meantime situation about E10 has defused and the demand for bioethanol is increasing steadily . Insofar the company assumes full use of bioethanol production capacities and profitable margins in the third and fourth quarter 2011 . In addition , the ramp-up of the biogas plant took more time than originally planned so that in total less biogas was produced . Meanwhile the production is stable . With regards to current political developments , the demand for biogas is significantly higher than originally expected .",3.199018,4.498204,True,True
